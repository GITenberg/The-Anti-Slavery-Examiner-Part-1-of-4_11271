         <p>
            A crisis has arrived, in which rights the most important which
            civil society can acknowledge, and which have been acknowledged
            by our Constitution and laws, in terms the most explicit which language
            can afford, are set at nought by men, whom your favor has
            invested with a brief authority. By what standard is your liberty
            of conscience, of speech, and of the press, now measured? Is it by
            those glorious charters you have inherited from your fathers, and
            which your present rulers have called Heaven to witness, they would
            preserve inviolate? Alas! another standard has been devised, and
            if we would know what rights are conceded to us by our own servants,
            we must consult the COMPACT by which the South engages on certain
            conditions to give its trade and votes to Northern men. All rights
            not allowed by this compact, we now hold by sufferance, and our
            Governors and Legislatures avow their readiness to deprive us of
            them, whenever in their opinion, legislation on the subject shall be
            "necessary<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE1_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE1_FN1"></a>." This compact is not indeed published to the world,
            under the hands and seals of the contracting parties, but it is set forth
            in official messages,&#8212;in resolutions of the State and National Legislatures&#8212;in
            the proceedings of popular meetings, and in acts of
            lawless violence. The temples of the Almighty have been sacked,
            because the worshipers did not conform their consciences to the
            compact<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE1_FN2"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE1_FN2"></a>.
            Ministers of the gospel have been dragged as criminals
            from the altar to the bar, because they taught the people from the
            Bible, doctrines proscribed by the
            compact<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE1_FN3"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootE1_FN3"></a>. Hundreds of free
            citizens, peaceably assembled to express their sentiments, have, because
            such an expression was forbidden by the compact, been forcibly

            dispersed, and the chief actor in this invasion on the freedom of
            speech, instead of being punished for a breach of the peace, was rewarded
            for his fidelity to the compact with an office of high trust and
            honor<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE1_FN4"><sup>D</sup></a><a name="FootE1_FN4"></a>.

            "The freedom of the press&#8212;the palladium of liberty," was once a
            household proverb. Now, a printing office<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE1_FN5"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE1_FN5"></a> is entered by ruffians,
            and its types scattered in the highway, because disobedient to the
            compact. A Grand Jury, sworn to "present all things truly as they
            come to their knowledge," refuse to indict the offenders; and a senator
            in Congress rises in his place, and appeals to the outrage in the
            printing office, and the conduct of the Grand Jury as evidence of the
            good faith with which the people of the state of New York were
            resolved to observe the compact<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE1_FN6"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE1_FN6"></a>.

            The Executive Magistrate of the American Union, unmindful of
            his obligation to execute the laws for the equal benefit of his fellow
            citizens, has sanctioned a censorship of the press, by which papers
            incompatible with the compact are excluded from the southern mails,
            and he has officially advised Congress to do by law, although in violation
            of the Constitution, what he had himself virtually done already
            in despite of both. The invitation has indeed been rejected, but by
            the Senate of the United States only, after a portentous struggle&#8212;a
            struggle which distinctly exhibited the <em>political</em> conditions of the compact,
            as well as the fidelity with which those conditions are observed
            by a northern candidate for the Presidency. While in compliance
            with these conditions, a powerful minority in the Senate were forging
            fetters for the PRESS, the House of Representatives were employed
            in breaking down the right of PETITION. On the 26th May last, the
            following resolution, reported by a committee was adopted by the
            House, viz.

         </p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>
               "Resolved, that all Petitions, Memorials, Resolutions
               and Propositions relating in any way, or to any extent
               whatever, to the subject of Slavery, shall without being
               either printed or referred, be laid on the table, and that
               no further action whatever shall be had thereon." Yeas,
               117. Nays, 68.

            </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>
            Bear with us, fellow countrymen, while we call your attention to
            the outrage on your rights, the contempt of personal obligations and
            the hardened cruelty involved in this detestable resolution. Condemn
            us not for the harshness of our language, before you hear our justification.
            We shall speak only the truth, but we shall speak it as
            freemen.

         </p>
         <p>
            The right of petition is founded in the very institution of civil government,
            and has from time immemorial been acknowledged as
            among the unquestionable privileges of our English ancestors. This
            right springs from the great truth that government is established for

            the benefit of the governed; and it forms the medium by which the
            people acquaint their rulers with their wants and their grievances.
            So accustomed were the Americans to the exercise of this right, even
            during their subjection to the British crown, that, on the formation
            of the Federal Constitution, the Convention not conceiving that it
            could be endangered, made no provision for its security. But in the
            very first Congress that assembled under the new Government, the
            omission was repaired. It was thought some case might possibly
            occur, in which this right might prove troublesome to a dominant
            faction, who would endeavor to stifle it. An amendment was therefore
            proposed and adopted, by which Congress is restrained from
            making any law abridging "the right of the People, peaceably to assemble,
            and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
            Had it not been for this prudent jealousy of our Fathers, instead of
            the resolution I have transcribed, we should have had a LAW, visiting
            with pains and penalties, all who dared to petition the Federal Government,
            in behalf of the victims of oppression, held in bondage by
            its authority. The present resolution cannot indeed consign such
            petitioners to the prison or the scaffold, but it makes the right to petition
            a congressional boon, to be granted or withheld at pleasure,
            and in the present case effectually withholds it, by tendering it
            nugatory.

         </p>
         <p>
            Petitions are to inform the Government of the wishes of the people,
            and by calling forth the action of the Legislature, to inform the constituents
            how far their wishes are respected by their representatives.
            The information thus mutually given and received is essential to a
            faithful and enlightened exercise of the right of legislation on the one
            hand, and of suffrage on the other. But the resolution we are considering,
            provides that no petition in relation to slavery, shall be
            printed for the information of the members, nor referred to a committee
            to ascertain the truth of its statements; nor shall any vote be
            taken, in regard to it, by which the People may learn the sentiments
            of their representatives.

         </p>
         <p>
            If Congress may thus dispose of petitions on one subject, they
            may make the same disposition of petitions on any and every other
            subject. Our representatives are bound by oath, not to pass any law
            abridging the right of petition, but if this resolution is constitutional,
            they may order every petition to be delivered to their door-keeper,
            and by him to be committed to the flames; for why preserve petitions
            on which <em>no action can be had</em>? Had the resolution been directed
            to petitions for an object palpably unconstitutional, it would
            still have been without excuse. The construction of the Constitution
            is a matter of opinion, and every citizen has a right to express that
            opinion in a petition, or otherwise.

         </p>
         <p>
            But this usurpation is aggravated by the almost universal admission
            that Congress does possess the constitutional power to legislate on
            the subject of slavery in the District of Columbia and the Territories.
            No wonder that a distinguished statesman refused to sanction the
            right of the House to pass such a resolution by even voting against

            it<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE1_FN7"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE1_FN7"></a>. The men
            who perpetrated this outrage had sworn to support
            the Constitution, and will they hereafter plead at the bar of their Maker,
            that they had kept their oath, because they had abridged the right
            of petition <em>by a resolution</em>, and not by law!

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE1_FN7"></a><a href="#FootE1_FN7">A</a>: Mr. J.Q. Adams, on his
            name being called, refused to vote, saying, "the resolution
            is in direct violation of the Constitution of the United States, and the
            privileges of the members of this House."
         </p>
         <p>
            This resolution not only violates the rights of the people, but it
            nullifies the privileges and obligations of their representatives. It is
            an undoubted right and duty of every member of Congress to propose
            any measure within the limits of the Constitution, which he believes
            is required by the interests of his constituents and the welfare of his
            country. Now mark the base surrender of this right&#8212;the wicked
            dereliction of this duty. All "resolutions and propositions" relating
            "in <em>any way</em> or to <em>any extent</em> whatever to the subject of slavery,"
            shall be laid on the table, and "no further action <em>whatever</em> shall be
            had thereon." What a spectacle has been presented to the American
            people!&#8212;one hundred and seventeen members of Congress relinquishing
            their own rights, cancelling their own solemn obligations,
            forcibly depriving the other members of their legislative privileges,
            abolishing the freedom of debate, condemning the right of petition,
            and prohibiting present and future legislation on a most important
            and constitutional subject, by a rule of order!

         </p>
         <p>
            In 1820, the New-York Legislature instructed the representatives
            from that state in Congress, to insist on making "the prohibition of
            slavery an indispensable condition of admission" of certain territories
            into the union. In 1828, the Legislature of Pennsylvania instructed
            the Pennsylvania members of Congress, to vote for the abolition of
            slavery in the district of Columbia. In vain hereafter shall a representative
            present the instructions of his constituents, or the injunctions
            of a sovereign state. No question shall be taken, or any
            motion he may offer, in <em>any way</em>, or to <em>any extent</em>, relating to slavery!

         </p>
         <p>
            Search the annals of legislation, and you will find no precedent for
            such a profligate act of tyranny, exercised by a majority over their
            fellow legislators, nor for such an impudent contempt of the rights
            of the people.

         </p>
         <p>
            But this resolution is no less barbarous than it is profligate and
            impudent. Remember, fellow countrymen! that the decree has
            gone forth, that there shall be no legislation by Congress, <em>in any
               way</em>, or to <em>any extent whatever</em>, on the subject of slavery. Now call
            to mind, that Congress is the local and only legislature of the District
            of Columbia, which is placed by the Constitution under its "exclusive
            jurisdiction <em>in all cases whatsoever</em>." In this District, there are thousands
            of human beings divested of the rights of humanity, and subjected
            to a negotiable despotism; and Congress is the only power
            that can extend the shield of law to protect them from cruelty and
            abuse; and that shield, it is now resolved, shall not be extended in
            any way, or to any extent! But this is not all. The District has
            become the great slave-market of North America, and the port of

            Alexandria is the Guinea of our proud republic, whence "cargoes of

         <p><a name="NoteE1_FN8"></a><a href="#FootE1_FN8">A</a>: One
            dealer, John Armfield, advertises in the National Intelligencer of the 10th
            of February last, that he has three vessels in the trade, and they will leave the port
            of Alexandria on the first and fifteenth of each month.
         </p>
         <p>
            In the city which bears the name of the Father of his country,
            dealers in human flesh receive licenses for the vile traffic, at four
            hundred dollars each per annum; and the gazettes of the Capital have
            their columns polluted with the advertisements of these men, offering
            cash for children and youth, who, torn from their parents and families,
            are to wear out their existence on the plantations of the south.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE1_FN9"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE1_FN9"></a>
            For the safe keeping of these children and youth, till they are shipped for
            the Mississippi, private pens and prisons are provided, and the UNITED STATES' JAIL
            used when required. The laws of the District in relation
            to slaves and free negroes are of the most abominable and iniquitous
            character. Any free citizen with a dark skin, may be arrested
            on pretence of being a fugitive slave, and committed to the UNITED STATES' PRISON,
            and unless within a certain number of days he
            proves his freedom, while immured within its walls, he is, under authority
            of Congress, sold as a slave for life. Do you ask why? Let
            the blood mantle in your cheeks, while we give you the answer of the
            LAW&#8212;"to pay his jail fees!!"

         <p><a name="NoteE1_FN9"></a><a href="#FootE1_FN9">A</a>: Twelve
            hundred negroes are thus advertised for in the National Intelligencer
            of the 28th of March last. The negroes wanted are generally from the age of ten
            or twelve years to twenty-five, and of both sexes.

            On the 11th of January, 1827, the Committee for the District of
            Columbia, (themselves slaveholders) introduced a bill providing that
            the jail fees should hereafter be a county charge. The bill did not
            pass; and by the late resolution, a statute unparalleled for injustice
            and atrocity by any mandate of European despotism, is to be like the
            law of the Medes and Persians, that altereth not, since no proposition
            for its repeal or modification can be entertained.

         </p>
         <p>
            The Grand Jury of Alexandria presented the slave trade of that
            place, as "disgraceful to our character as citizens of a free government,"
            and as "a grievance demanding legislative redress;" that is,
            the interposition of Congress&#8212;but one hundred and seventeen men
            have decided that there shall be "no action whatever" by Congress
            in relation to slavery.

         </p>
         <p>
            In March, 1816, John Randolph submitted the following resolution
            to the House of Representatives: "<em>Resolved</em>, That a Committee be
            appointed to inquire into the existence of an <em>inhuman</em> and illegal
            traffic of slaves, carried on in and through the District of Columbia,
            and to report whether any, and what measures are necessary for putting
            a stop to the same." The COMPACT had not then been formed
            and the resolution <em>was adopted</em>. Such a resolution would <em>now</em> "be
            laid on the table," and treated with silent contempt.

         </p>
         <p>
            In 1828, eleven hundred inhabitants of the District presented a
            petition to Congress, complaining of the "DOMESTIC SLAVE-TRADE"
            as a grievance disgraceful in its character, and "even more demoralizing

            its influence" than the foreign traffic. The petition concluded
            as follows: "The people of this District have within themselves no
            means of legislative redress, and we therefore appeal to your Honorable
            body as the <em>only one</em> vested by the American Constitution with
            power to relieve us." No more shall such appeals be made to the
            national council. What matters it, that the people of the District are
            annoyed by the human shambles opened among them? What matters
            it, that Congress is "the only body vested by the American Constitution
            with power to relieve" them? The compact requires that no
            action shall be had on <em>any</em> petition relating to slavery.

         </p>
         <p>
            The horse or the ox may be protected in the District, by act of
            Congress, from the cruelty of its owner; but MAN, created in the
            image of God, shall, if his complexion be dark, be abandoned to every
            outrage. The negro may be bound alive to the stake in front of the
            Capitol, as well as in the streets of St. Louis&#8212;his shrieks may resound
            through the representative hall&#8212;and the stench of his burning body
            may enter the nostrils of the law-givers&#8212;but no vote may rebuke the
            abomination&#8212;no law forbid its repetition.

         </p>
         <p>
            The representatives of the nation may regulate the traffic in sheep
            and swine, within the ten miles square; but the SLAVERS of the District
            may be laden to suffocation with human cattle&#8212;the horrors of
            the middle passage may be transcended at the wharves of Alexandria;
            but Congress may not limit the size of the cargoes, or provide for the
            due feeding and watering the animals composing them!&#8212;The District
            of Columbia is henceforth to be the only spot on the face of the globe,
            subjected to a civilized and Christian police, in which avarice and
            malice may with legal impunity inflict on humanity whatever sufferings
            ingenuity can devise, or depravity desire.

         </p>
         <p>
            And this accumulation of wickedness, cruelty and baseness, is to
            render the seat of the federal government the scoff of tyrants and the
            reproach of freemen FOREVER! On the 9th of January 1829, the
            House of Representatives passed the following vote. "<em>Resolved</em>, that
            the committee of the District of Columbia be instructed to inquire into
            the expediency of providing by law, for the gradual abolition of Slavery
            in the District, in such manner that no individual shall be injured
            thereby." Never again while the present rule of order is in force,
            can similar instructions be given to a committee&#8212;never again shall
            even an inquiry be made into the expediency of abolishing slavery
            and the slave-trade in the District. What stronger evidence can we
            have, of the growing and spreading corruption caused by slavery,
            than that one hundred and seventeen republican legislators professed
            believers in Christianity&#8212;many of them from the North, aye even
            from the land of the Pilgrims, should strive to render such curses
            PERPETUAL!

         </p>
         <p>
            The flagitiousness of this resolution is aggravated if possible by
            the arbitrary means by which its adoption was secured. No representative
            of the People was permitted to lift up his voice against it&#8212;to
            plead the commands of the Constitution which is violated&#8212;his
            own privileges and duties which it contemned&#8212;the rights of his
            constituents

            on which it trampled&#8212;the chains of justice and humanity
            which it impiously outraged. Its advocates were afraid and ashamed
            to discuss it, and forbidding debate, they perpetrated in silence the
            most atrocious act that has ever disgraced an American
            Legislature<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE1_FN10"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE1_FN10"></a>. And was no reason whatever, it may be asked, assigned for this
            bold invasion of our rights, this insult to the sympathies of our common
            nature? Yes&#8212;connected with the resolution was a preamble
            explaining its OBJECT. Read it, fellow countrymen, and be equally
            astonished at the impudence of your rulers in avowing such an object,
            and at their folly in adopting such an expedient to effect it. The lips
            of a free people are to be sealed by insult and injury!

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE1_FN10"></a><a href="#FootE1_FN10">A</a>:  A debate was allowed on a motion to
            re-commit the report, for the purpose of preparing a resolution that Congress
            has no constitutional power to interfere with
            slavery in the District of Columbia; but when the sense of the House was to be
            taken on the resolution reported by the committees, all debate was prevented by
            the previous question.
         </p>
         <p>
            "Whereas, it is extremely important and desirable that the AGITATION
            on this subject should be finally ARRESTED, for the purpose of
            restoring <em>tranquillity</em> to the public mind, your committee respectfully
            recommend the following resolution."

         </p>
         <p>
            ORDER REIGNS IN WARSAW, were the terms in which the triumph
            of Russia over the liberties of Poland was announced to the world.
            When the right of petition shall be broken down&#8212;when no whisper
            shalt be heard in Congress in behalf of human rights&#8212;when the press
            shall be muzzled, and the freedom of speech destroyed by gag-laws,
            then will the slaveholders announce, that TRANQUILLITY IS RESTORED TO THE PUBLIC MIND!

         </p>
         <p>
            Fellow countrymen! is such the tranquillity you desire&#8212;is such
            the heritage you would leave to your children? Suffer not the present
            outrage, by effecting its avowed object, to invite farther aggressions
            on your rights. The chairman of the committee boasted that
            the number of petitioners the present session, for the abolition of slavery
            in the District, was <em>only</em> thirty-four thousand! Let us resolve,
            we beseech you, that at the next session the number shall be A MILLION.
            Perhaps our one hundred and seventeen representatives will
            then abandon in despair their present dangerous and unconstitutional
            expedient for tranquilizing the public mind.

         </p>
         <p>
            The purpose of this address, is not to urge upon you our own views
            of the sinfulness of slavery, and the safety of its immediate abolition;
            but to call your attention to the conduct of your rulers. Let no one
            think for a moment, that because he is not an abolitionist, his liberties
            are not and will not be invaded. <em>We</em> have no rights, distinct from
            the rights of the whole people. Calumny, falsehood, and popular
            violence, have been employed in vain, to tranquilize abolitionists.
            It is now proposed to soothe them, by despoiling them of their Constitutional
            rights; but they cannot be despoiled <em>alone</em>. The right of
            petition and the freedom of debate are as sacred and valuable to those
            who dissent from our opinions, as they are to ourselves. Can the
            Constitution at the same time secure liberty to you, and expose us to

            oppression&#8212;give you freedom of speech, and lock our lips&#8212;respect
            your right of petition, and treat ours with contempt? No, fellow
            countrymen!&#8212;we must be all free, or all slaves together. We implore
            you, then, by all the obligations of interest, of patriotism, and of
            religion&#8212;by the remembrance of your Fathers&#8212;by your love for your
            children, to unite with us in maintaining our common, and till lately,
            our unquestioned political rights.

         </p>
         <p>
            We ask you as men to insist that your servants acting as the local
            legislators of the District of Columbia, shall respect the common
            rights and decencies of humanity.&#8212;We ask you as freemen, not to
            permit your constitutional privileges to be trifled with, by those who
            have sworn to maintain them.&#8212;We ask you as Christian men, to remember
            that by sanctioning the sinful acts of your agents, you yourselves
            assume their guilt.

         </p>
         <p>
            We have no candidates to recommend to your favor&#8212;we ask not
            your support for any political party; but we do ask you to give your
            suffrages hereafter only to such men as you have reason to believe
            will not sacrifice your rights, and their own obligations, and the claims
            of mercy and the commands of God, to an iniquitous and mercenary
            COMPACT. If we cannot have northern Presidents and other officers
            of the general government except in exchange for freedom of conscience,
            of speech, of the press and of legislation, then let all the
            appointments at Washington be given to the South. If slaveholders
            will not trade with us, unless we consent to be slaves ourselves, then
            let us leave their money, and their sugar, and their cotton, to perish
            with them.

         </p>
         <p>
            Fellow countrymen! we wish, we recommend no action whatever,
            inconsistent with the laws and constitutions of our country, or the
            precepts of our common religion, but we beseech you to join with us
            in resolving, that while we will respect the rights of others, we will at
            every hazard maintain our own.

         <p>RESPECTED FRIENDS,</p>
         <p>
            It is because I feel a deep and tender interest in your present and
            eternal welfare that I am willing thus publicly to address you. Some
            of you have loved me as a relative, and some have felt bound to me
            in Christian sympathy, and Gospel fellowship; and even when compelled
            by a strong sense of duty, to break those outward bonds of
            union which bound us together as members of the same community,
            and members of the same religious denomination, you were generous
            enough to give me credit, for sincerity as a Christian, though you
            believed I had been most strangely deceived. I thanked you then
            for your kindness, and I ask you <em>now</em>, for the sake of former confidence,
            and former friendship, to read the following pages in the spirit
            of calm investigation and fervent prayer. It is because you have
            known me, that I write thus unto you.

         </p>
         <p>
            But there are other Christian women scattered over the Southern
            States, and of these, a very large number have never seen me, and
            never heard my name, and feel <em>no</em> personal interest whatever in <em>me</em>.
            But I feel an interest in <em>you</em>, as branches of the same vine from whose
            root I daily draw the principle of spiritual vitality&#8212;Yes! Sisters
            in Christ I feel an interest in <em>you</em>, and often has the secret prayer
            arisen on your behalf, Lord "open thou their eyes that they may see
            wondrous things out of thy Law"&#8212;It is then, because I <em>do feel</em> and
            <em>do pray</em> for you, that I thus address you upon a subject about which
            of all others, perhaps you would rather not hear any thing; but,
            "would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly, and indeed
            bear with me, for I am jealous over you with godly jealousy."
            Be not afraid then to read my appeal; it is <em>not</em> written in the heat of
            passion or prejudice, but in that solemn calmness which is the result
            of conviction and duty. It is true, I am going to tell you unwelcome
            truths, but I mean to speak those <em>truths in love</em>, and remember
            Solomon says, "faithful are the <em>wounds</em> of a friend." I do not believe
            the time has yet come when <em>Christian women</em> "will not endure
            sound doctrine," even on the subject of Slavery, if it is spoken to
            them in tenderness and love, therefore I now address <em>you</em>.

            To all of you then, known or unknown, relatives or strangers, (for
            you are all <em>one</em> to Christ,) I would speak. I have felt for you at this
            time, when unwelcome light is pouring in upon the world on the
            subject of slavery; light which even Christians would exclude, if
            they could, from our country, or at any rate from the southern portion
            of it, saying, as its rays strike the rock bound coasts of New
            England and scatter their warmth and radiance over her hills and
            valleys, and from thence travel onward over the Palisades of the
            Hudson, and down the soft flowing waters of the Delaware and
            gild the waves of the Potomac, "hitherto shalt thou come and no
            further;" I know that even professors of His name who has been
            emphatically called the "Light of the world" would, if they could,
            build a wall of adamant around the Southern States whose top might
            reach unto heaven, in order to shut out the light which is bounding
            from mountain to mountain and from the hills to the plains and valleys
            beneath, through the vast extent of our Northern States. But
            believe me, when I tell you, their attempts will be as utterly fruitless
            as were the efforts of the builders of Babel; and why? Because
            moral, like natural light, is so extremely subtle in its nature as to
            overleap all human barriers, and laugh at the puny efforts of man to
            control it. All the excuses and palliations of this system must inevitably
            be swept away, just as other "refuges of lies" have been, by
            the irresistible torrent of a rectified public opinion. "The <em>supporters</em>
            of the slave system," says Jonathan Dymond in his admirable work
            on the Principles of Morality, "will <em>hereafter</em> be regarded with the <em>same</em>
            public feeling, as he who was an advocate for the slave trade <em>now is</em>."
            It will be, and that very soon, clearly perceived and fully acknowledged
            by all the virtuous and the candid, that in <em>principle</em> it is as
            sinful to hold a human being in bondage who has been born in
            Carolina, as one who has been born in Africa. All that sophistry
            of argument which has been employed to prove, that although it is
            sinful to send to Africa to procure men and women as slaves, who
            have never been in slavery, that still, it is not sinful to keep those in
            bondage who have come down by inheritance, will be utterly overthrown.
            We must come back to the good old doctrine of our forefathers
            who declared to the world, "this self evident truth that <em>all</em>
            men are created equal, and that they have certain <em>inalienable</em> rights
            among which are life, <em>liberty</em>, and the pursuit of happiness." It is
            even a greater absurdity to suppose a man can be legally born a
            slave under <em>our free Republican</em> Government, than under the petty
            despotisms of barbarian Africa. If then, we have no right to enslave
            an African, surely we can have none to enslave an American; if it is
            a self evident truth that <em>all</em> men, every where and of every color are
            born equal, and have an <em>inalienable right to liberty</em>, then it is equally
            true that <em>no</em> man can be born a slave, and no man can ever <em>rightfully</em>
            be reduced to <em>involuntary</em> bondage and held as a slave, however fair
            may be the claim of his master or mistress through wills and title-deeds.

         </p>
         <p>
            But after all, it may be said, our fathers were certainly mistaken, for
            the Bible sanctions Slavery, and that is the highest authority. Now
            the Bible is my ultimate appeal in all matters of faith and practice,
            and it is to <em>this test</em> I am anxious to bring the subject at issue between
            us. Let us then begin with Adam and examine the charter
            of privileges which was given to him. "Have dominion over the fish
            of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing
            that moveth upon the earth." In the eighth Psalm we have a still
            fuller description of this charter which through Adam was given to all
            mankind. "Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of
            thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet. All sheep and
            oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field, the fowl of the air, the fish of
            the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas."
            And after the flood when this charter of human rights was renewed,
            we find <em>no additional</em> power vested in man. "And the fear of you
            and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and
            every fowl of the air, and upon all that moveth upon the earth, and
            upon all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered."
            In this charter, although the different kinds of <em>irrational</em> beings are
            so particularly enumerated, and supreme dominion over <em>all of them</em> is
            granted, yet <em>man</em> is <em>never</em> vested with this dominion <em>over his fellow
               man;</em> he was never told that any of the human species were put
            <em>under his feet;</em> it was only <em>all things</em>, and man, who was created in
            the image of his Maker, <em>never</em> can properly be termed a <em>thing</em>, though
            the laws of Slave States do call him "a chattel personal;" <em>Man</em>
            then, I assert <em>never</em> was put <em>under the feet of man</em>, by that first charter
            of human rights which was given by God, to the Fathers of the
            Antediluvian
            and Postdiluvian worlds, therefore this doctrine of equality
            is based on the Bible.

         </p>
         <p>
            But it may be argued, that in the very chapter of Genesis from
            which I have last quoted, will be found the curse pronounced upon
            Canaan, by which his posterity was consigned to servitude under his
            brothers Shem and Japheth. I know this prophecy was uttered, and
            was most fearfully and wonderfully fulfilled, through the immediate
            descendants of Canaan, <i>i.e.</i> the Canaanites, and I do not know but
            it has been through all the children of Ham, but I do know that
            prophecy does <em>not</em> tell us what <em>ought to be</em>, but what actually does
            take place, ages after it has been delivered, and that if we justify
            America for enslaving the children of Africa, we must also justify
            Egypt for reducing the children of Israel to bondage, for the latter
            was foretold as explicitly as the former. I am well aware that
            prophecy
            has often been urged as an excuse for Slavery, but be not
            deceived, the fulfillment of prophecy will <em>not cover one sin</em> in the awful
            day of account. Hear what our Saviour says on this subject; "it
            must needs be that offences come, but <em>woe unto that man through
               whom they come</em>"&#8212;Witness some fulfillment of this declaration in the
            tremendous destruction of Jerusalem, occasioned by that most nefarious

            of all crimes the crucifixion of the Son of God. Did the fact
            of that event having been foretold, exculpate the Jews from sin in
            perpetrating it; No&#8212;for hear what the Apostle Peter says to them
            on this subject, "Him being delivered by the determinate counsel
            and foreknowledge of God, <em>ye</em> have taken, and by <em>wicked</em> hands have
            crucified and slain." Other striking instances might be adduced, but
            these will suffice.

         </p>
         <p>
            But it has been urged that the patriarchs held slaves, and therefore,
            slavery is right. Do you really believe that patriarchal servitude was
            like American slavery? Can you believe it? If so, read the history of
            these primitive fathers of the church and be undeceived. Look at
            Abraham, though so great a man, going to the herd himself and
            fetching a calf from thence and serving it up with his own hands, for
            the entertainment of his guests. Look at Sarah, that princess as her
            name signifies, baking cakes upon the hearth. If the servants they
            had were like Southern slaves, would they have performed such
            comparatively menial offices for themselves? Hear too the plaintive
            lamentation of Abraham when he feared he should have no son to
            bear his name down to posterity. "Behold thou hast given me no
            seed, &amp;c., one born in my house <em>is mine</em> heir." From this it appears
            that one of his <em>servants</em> was to inherit his immense estate. Is this
            like Southern slavery? I leave it to your own good sense and candor
            to decide. Besides, such was the footing upon which Abraham was
            with <em>his</em> servants, that he trusted them with arms. Are slaveholders
            willing to put swords and pistols into the hands of their slaves? He
            was as a father among his servants; what are planters and masters
            generally among theirs? When the institution of circumcision was
            established, Abraham was commanded thus; "He that is eight days
            old shall be circumcised among you, <em>every</em> man-child in your
            generations; he that is born in the house, or bought with money of
            any stranger which is not of thy seed." And to render this command
            with regard to his <em>servants</em> still more impressive it is repeated
            in the very next verse; and herein we may perceive the great care
            which was taken by God to guard the <em>rights of servants</em> even under
            this "dark dispensation." What too was the testimony given to the
            faithfulness of this eminent patriarch. "For I know him that he will
            command his children and his <em>household</em> after him, and they shall
            keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment." Now my
            dear friends many of you believe that circumcision has been superseded
            by baptism in the Church; <em>Are you</em> careful to have <em>all</em> that
            are born in your house or bought with money of any stranger, baptized?
            Are <em>you</em> as faithful as Abraham to command <em>your household to
               keep the way of the Lord?</em> I leave it to your own consciences to decide.
            Was patriarchal servitude then like American Slavery?

         </p>
         <p>
            But I shall be told, God sanctioned Slavery, yea commanded Slavery
            under the Jewish Dispensation. Let us examine this subject
            calmly and prayerfully. I admit that a species of <em>servitude</em> was permitted
            to the Jews, but in studying the subject I have been struck
            with wonder and admiration at perceiving how carefully the servant

            was guarded from violence, injustice and wrong. I will first inform
            you how these servants became servants, for I think this a very important
            part of our subject. From consulting Horne, Calmet and
            the Bible, I find there were six different ways by which the Hebrews
            became servants legally.

         </p>
         <p>
            1. If reduced to extreme poverty, a Hebrew might sell himself,
            i.e. his services, for six years, in which case <em>he</em> received the purchase
            money <em>himself</em>. Lev. xxv, 39.

         </p>
         <p>
            2. A father might sell his children as servants, i.e. his <em>daughters</em>,
            in which circumstance it was understood the daughter was to be the
            wife or daughter-in-law of the man who bought her, and the <em>father</em>
            received the price. In other words, Jewish women were sold as <em>white
               women</em> were in the first settlement of Virginia&#8212;as <em>wives</em>, <em>not</em> as slaves.
            Ex. xxi, 7.

         </p>
         <p>
            3. Insolvent debtors might be delivered to their creditors as
            servants. 2 Kings iv, 1.

         </p>
         <p>
            4. Thieves not able to make restitution for their thefts, were sold
            for the benefit of the injured person. Ex. xxii, 3.

         </p>
         <p>
            5. They might be born in servitude. Ex. xxi, 4.

         </p>
         <p>
            6. If a Hebrew had sold himself to a rich Gentile, he might be
            redeemed by one of his brethren at any time the money was offered;
            and he who redeemed him, was <em>not</em> to take advantage of the favor
            thus conferred, and rule over him with rigor. Lev. xxv, 47-55.

         </p>
         <p>
            Before going into an examination of the laws by which these servants
            were protected, I would just ask whether American slaves have become
            slaves in any of the ways in which the Hebrews became servants.
            Did they sell themselves into slavery and receive the purchase money
            into their own hands? No! Did they become insolvent, and by their
            own imprudence subject themselves to be sold as slaves? No! Did
            they steal the property of another, and were they sold to make restitution
            for their crimes? No! Did their present masters, as an act of
            kindness, redeem them from some heathen tyrant to whom <em>they had
               sold themselves</em> in the dark hour of adversity? No! Were they born
            in slavery? No! No! not according to <em>Jewish Law</em>, for the servants
            who were born in servitude among them, were born of parents who
            had <em>sold themselves</em> for six years: Ex. xxi, 4. Were the female
            slaves of the South sold by their fathers? How shall I answer this
            question? Thousands and tens of thousands never were, <em>their</em> fathers
            <em>never</em> have received the poor compensation of silver or gold for the
            tears and toils, the suffering, and anguish, and hopeless bondage of
            <em>their</em> daughters. They labor day by day, and year by year, side by
            side, in the same field, if haply their daughters are permitted to remain
            on the same plantation with them, instead of being as they often
            are, separated from their parents and sold into distant states, never
            again to meet on earth. But do the <em>fathers of the South ever sell their
               daughters?</em> My heart beats, and my hand trembles, as I write the
            awful affirmative, Yes! The fathers of this Christian land often sell
            their daughters, <em>not</em> as Jewish parents did, to be the wives and daughters-in-law of the man who buys them, but to be the abject slaves of

            petty tyrants and irresponsible masters. Is it not so, my friends?
            I leave it to your own candor to corroborate my assertion. Southern
            slaves then have <em>not</em> become slaves in any of the six different ways
            in which Hebrews became servants, and I hesitate not to say that
            American masters <em>cannot</em> according to <em>Jewish law</em> substantiate their
            claim to the men, women, or children they now hold in bondage.

         </p>
         <p>
            But there was one way in which a Jew might illegally be reduced
            to servitude; it was this, he might he <em>stolen</em> and afterwards sold as a
            slave, as was Joseph. To guard most effectually against this dreadful
            crime of manstealing, God enacted this severe law. "He that
            stealeth a man and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall
            surely be put to death<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE2_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE2_FN1"></a>." As I have tried American Slavery by
            <em>legal</em> Hebrew servitude, and found, (to your surprise, perhaps,) that
            Jewish law cannot justify the slaveholder's claim, let us now try it by
            <em>illegal</em> Hebrew bondage. Have the Southern slaves then been
            stolen? If they did not sell themselves into bondage; if they were
            not sold as insolvent debtors or as thieves; if they were not redeemed
            from a heathen master to whom they had sold themselves; if they were
            not born in servitude according to Hebrew law; and if the females
            were not sold by their fathers as wives and daughters-in-law to those
            who purchased them; then what shall we say of them? what can we
            say of them? but that according <em>to Hebrew Law they have been stolen</em>.

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE2_FN1"></a><a href="#FootE2_FN1">A</a>: And again, "If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of
            Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then <em>that
               thief shall die</em>, and thou shalt put away evil from among
            you." Deut. xxiv, 7.
         </p>
         <p>
            But I shall be told that the Jews had other servants who were
            absolute slaves. Let us look a little into this also. They had other
            servants who were procured in two different ways.

         </p>
         <p>
            1. Captives taken in war were reduced to bondage instead of
            being killed; but we are not told that their children were enslaved.
            Deut. xx, 14.

         </p>
         <p>
            2. Bondmen and bondmaids might be bought from the heathen
            round about them; these were left by fathers to their children after
            them, but it does not appear that the <em>children</em> of these servants ever
            were reduced to servitude. Lev. xxv, 44.

         </p>
         <p>
            I will now try the right of the southern planter by the claims of
            Hebrew masters over their <em>heathen</em> slaves. Were the southern slaves
            taken captive in war? No! Were they bought from the heathen?
            No! for surely, no one will <em>now</em> vindicate the slave-trade so far as
            to assert that slaves were bought from the heathen who were obtained
            by that system of piracy. The only excuse for holding southern
            slaves is that they were born in slavery, but we have seen that they
            were <em>not</em> born in servitude as Jewish servants were, and that the
            children of heathen slaves were not legally subjected to bondage
            even under the Mosaic Law. How then have the slaves of the
            South been obtained?

         </p>
         <p>
            I will next proceed to an examination of those laws which were
            enacted in order to protect the Hebrew and the Heathen servant; for
            I wish you to understand that <em>both</em> are protected by Him, of whom it is

            said "his mercies are over all his works." I will first speak of those
            which secured the rights of Hebrew servants. This code was
            headed thus:

         </p>
         <p>
            1. Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God.

         </p>
         <p>
            2. If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve, and in
            the seventh year he shall go out free for nothing. Ex. xx,
            2<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE2_FN2"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE2_FN2"></a>.

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE2_FN2"></a><a href="#FootE2_FN2">A</a>: And when thou sendest him out free
            from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty: Thou shalt furnish him
            <em>liberally</em> out of thy flock and out of thy floor, and
            out of thy wine-press: of that wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed thee, shalt
            thou give unto him. Deut. xv, 13, 14.
         </p>
         <p>
            3. If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he were
            married, then his wife shall go out with him.

         </p>
         <p>
            4. If his master have given him a wife and she have borne him sons
            and daughters, the wife and her children shall be his master's, and he
            shall go out by himself.

         </p>
         <p>
            5. If the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and
            my children; I will not go out free; then his master shall bring him
            unto the Judges, and he shall bring him to the door, or unto the
            door-post, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and
            he shall serve him <em>forever</em>. Ex. xxi, 3-6.

         </p>
         <p>
            6. If a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid,
            that it perish, he shall let him go <em>free</em> for his eye's sake. And if he
            smite out his man servant's tooth or his maid servant's tooth, he shall
            let him go <em>free</em> for his tooth's sake. Ex. xxi, 26, 27.

         </p>
         <p>
            7. On the Sabbath rest was secured to servants by the fourth commandment. Ex. xx, 10.

         </p>
         <p>
            8. Servants were permitted to unite with their masters three times
            in every year in celebrating the Passover, the feast of Pentecost, and
            the feast of Tabernacles; every male throughout the land was to
            appear before the Lord at Jerusalem with a gift; here the bond and
            the free stood on common ground. Deut. xvi.

         </p>
         <p>
            9. If a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die
            under his hand, he shall be surely punished. Notwithstanding, if he
            continue a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money.
            Ex. xxi, 20, 21.

         </p>
         <p>
            From these laws we learn that Hebrew men servants were bound
            to serve their masters <em>only six</em> years, unless their attachment to their
            employers, their wives and children, should induce them to wish to
            remain in servitude, in which case, in order to prevent the possibility
            of deception on the part of the master, the servant was first taken
            before the magistrate, where he openly declared his intention of continuing in his master's service, (probably a public register
            was kept
            of such) he was then conducted to the door of the house, (in warm
            climates doors are thrown open,) and <em>there</em> his ear was <em>publicly</em> bored,
            and by submitting to this operation he testified his willingness to serve
            him <em>forever</em>, i.e. during his life, for Jewish Rabbins who must have
            understood Jewish <em>slavery</em>, (as it is called,) "affirm that servants
            were set free at the death of their masters and did <em>not</em> descend to
            their heirs:" or that he was to serve him until the year of Jubilee,

            when <em>all</em> servants were set at liberty. To protect servants from
            violence, it was ordained that if a master struck out the tooth or
            destroyed the eye of a servant, that servant immediately became
            <em>free</em>, for such an act of violence evidently showed he was unfit to
            possess the power of a master, and therefore that power was taken
            from him. All servants enjoyed the rest of the Sabbath and partook
            of the privileges and festivities of the three great Jewish Feasts; and
            if a servant died under the infliction of chastisement, his master was
            surely to be punished. As a tooth for a tooth and life for life was the
            Jewish law, of course he was punished with death. I know that
            great stress has been laid upon the following verse: "Notwithstanding,
            if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is
            his money."

         </p>
         <p>
            Slaveholders, and the apologists of slavery, have eagerly seized
            upon this little passage of scripture, and held it up as the masters'
            Magna Charta, by which they were licensed by God himself to
            commit the greatest outrages upon the defenceless victims of their
            oppression. But, my friends, was it designed to be so? If our Heavenly
            Father would protect by law the eye and the tooth of a Hebrew
            servant, can we for a moment believe that he would abandon that
            same servant to the brutal rape of a master who would destroy even
            life itself. Do we not rather see in this, the <em>only</em> law which protected
            masters, and was it not right that in case of the death of a servant, one
            or two days after chastisement was inflicted, to which other circumstances
            might have contributed, that the master should be protected
            when, in all probability, he never intended to produce so fatal a result?
            But the phrase "he is his money" has been adduced to show that
            Hebrew servants were regarded as mere <em>things</em>, "chattels personal;"
            if so, why were so many laws made to <em>secure their rights as men</em>, and
            to ensure their rising into equality and freedom? If they were mere
            <em>things</em>, why were they regarded as responsible beings, and one law
            made for them as well as for their masters? But I pass on now to
            the consideration of how the <em>female</em> Jewish servants were protected
            by <em>law</em>.

         </p>
         <p>
            1. If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself,
            then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto another nation
            he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.

         </p>
         <p>
            2. If he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her
            after the manner of daughters.

         </p>
         <p>
            3. If he take him another wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty
            of marriage, shall he not diminish.

         </p>
         <p>
            4. If he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out <em>free</em>
            without money.

         </p>
         <p>
            On these laws I will give you Calmet's remarks; "A father could
            not sell his daughter as a slave, according to the Rabbins, until she
            was at the age of puberty, and unless he were reduced to the utmost
            indigence. Besides, when a master bought an Israelitish girl, it was
            <em>always</em> with the presumption that he would take her to wife."
            Hence Moses adds, "if she please not her master, and he does not think fit

            to marry her, he shall set her at liberty," or according to the Hebrew,
            "he shall let her be redeemed." "To sell her to another nation he shall
            have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her;" as to the
            engagement implied, at least of taking her to wife. "If he have betrothed
            her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of
            daughters, i.e. he shall take care that his son uses her as his wife,
            that he does not despise or maltreat her. If he make his son marry
            another wife, he shall give her her dowry, her clothes and compensation
            for her virginity; if he does none of these three, she shall <em>go out free</em>
            without money." Thus were the <em>rights of female servants carefully
               secured by law</em> under the Jewish Dispensation; and now I would
            ask, are the rights of female slaves at the South thus secured? Are
            <em>they</em> sold only as wives and daughters-in-law, and when not treated
            as such, are they allowed to <em>go out free</em>? No! They have <em>all</em> not
            only been illegally obtained as servants according to Hebrew law,
            but they are also illegally <em>held</em> in bondage. Masters at the South
            and West have all forfeited their claims, (<em>if they ever had any</em>,) to
            their female slaves.

         </p>
         <p>
            We come now to examine the case of those servants who were "of
            the heathen round about;" Were <em>they</em> left entirely unprotected by
            law? Horne in speaking of the law, "Thou shalt not rule over him
            with rigor, but shalt fear thy God," remarks, "this law Lev. xxv, 43;
            it is true speaks expressly of slaves who were of Hebrew descent;
            but as <em>alien born</em> slaves were ingrafted into the Hebrew Church by
            circumcision, <em>there is no doubt</em> but that it applied to <em>all</em> slaves;" if so,
            then we may reasonably suppose that the other protective laws extended
            to them also; and that the only difference between Hebrew
            and Heathen servants lay in this, that the former served but six years
            unless they chose to remain longer; and were always freed at the
            death of their masters; whereas the latter served until the year of
            Jubilee, though that might include a period of forty-nine years,&#8212;and
            were left from father to son.

         </p>
         <p>
            There are however two other laws which I have not yet noticed.
            The one effectually prevented <em>all involuntary</em> servitude, and the other
            completely abolished Jewish servitude every fifty years. They were
            equally operative upon the Heathen and the Hebrew.

         </p>
         <p>
            1. "Thou shall <em>not</em> deliver unto his master the servant that is escaped
            from his master unto thee. He shall dwell with thee, even
            among you, in that place which he shall choose, in one of thy gates
            where it liketh him best: thou shall <em>not</em> oppress him." Deut. xxxiii;
            15, 16.

         </p>
         <p>
            2. "And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim <em>Liberty</em>
            throughout <em>all</em> the land, unto <em>all</em> the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a
            jubilee unto you." Deut. xxv, 10.

         </p>
         <p>
            Here, then, we see that by this first law, the <em>door of Freedom was
               opened wide to every servant who</em> had any cause whatever for complaint;
            if he was unhappy with his master, all he had to do was to leave him,
            and <em>no man</em> had a right to deliver him back to him again, and not only
            so, but the absconded servant was to <em>choose</em> where he should live,

            and no Jew was permitted to oppress him. He left his master just
            as our Northern servants leave us; we have no power to compel them
            to remain with us, and no man has any right to oppress them; they
            go and dwell in that place where it chooseth them, and live just where
            they like. Is it so at the South? Is the poor runaway slave protected
            <em>by law</em> from the violence of that master whose oppression and
            cruelty has driven him from his plantation or his house? No! no!
            Even the free states of the North are compelled to deliver unto his
            master the servant that is escaped from his master into them. By
            <em>human</em> law, under the <em>Christian Dispensation</em>, in the <em>nineteenth century</em>
            we are commanded to do, what <em>God</em> more than <em>three thousand</em> years
            ago, under the <em>Mosaic Dispensation</em>, <em>positively commanded</em> the Jews
            <em>not</em> to do. In the wide domain even of our free states, there is not
            <em>one</em> city of refuge for the poor runaway fugitive; not one spot upon
            which he can stand and say, I am a free man&#8212;I am protected in my
            rights as a <em>man</em>, by the strong arm of the law; no! <em>not one</em>. How
            long the North will thus shake hands with the South in sin, I know
            not. How long she will stand by like the persecutor Saul, <em>consenting</em>
            unto the death of Stephen, and keeping the raiment of them that slew
            him, I know not; but one thing I do know, the <em>guilt of the North</em>
            is increasing in a tremendous ratio as light is pouring in upon her on
            the subject and the sin of slavery. As the sun of righteousness
            climbs higher and higher in the moral heavens, she will stand still
            more and more abashed as the query is thundered down into her ear,
            "<em>Who</em> hath required <em>this</em> at thy hand?" It will be found <em>no</em> excuse then
            that the Constitution of our country required that <em>persons bound to service</em>
            escaping from their masters should be delivered up; no more
            excuse than was the reason which Adam assigned for eating the forbidden
            fruit. <em>He was condemned and punished because</em> he hearkened
            to the voice of <em>his wife</em>, rather than to the command of his Maker; and
            <em>we</em> will assuredly be condemned and punished for obeying <em>Man</em> rather
            than <em>God</em>, if we do not speedily repent and bring forth fruits meet for
            repentance. Yea, are we not receiving chastisement even <em>now</em>?

         </p>
         <p>
            But by the second of these laws a still more astonishing fact is
            disclosed. If the first effectually prevented <em>all involuntary servitude</em>,
            the last absolutely forbade even <em>voluntary servitude being perpetual</em>.
            On the great day of atonement every fiftieth year the Jubilee trumpet
            was sounded throughout the land of Judea, and <em>Liberty</em> was proclaimed
            to <em>all</em> the inhabitants thereof. I will not say that the servants'
            <em>chains</em> fell off and their <em>manacles</em> were burst, for there is no evidence
            that Jewish servants <em>ever</em> felt the weight of iron chains, and collars,
            and handcuffs; but I do say that even the man who had voluntarily
            sold himself and the <em>heathen</em> who had been sold to a Hebrew master,
            were set free, the one as well as the other. This law was evidently
            designed to prevent the oppression of the poor, and the possibility of
            such a thing as <em>perpetual servitude</em> existing among them.

         </p>
         <p>
            Where, then, I would ask, is the warrant, the justification, or the
            palliation of American Slavery from Hebrew servitude? How many
            of the southern slaves would now be in bondage according to the

            laws of Moses; Not one. You may observe that I have carefully
            avoided using the term <em>slavery</em> when speaking of Jewish servitude;
            and simply for this reason, that <em>no such thing</em> existed among that
            people; the word translated servant does <em>not</em> mean <em>slave</em>, it is the
            same that is applied to Abraham, to Moses, to Elisha and the prophets
            generally. <em>Slavery</em> then <em>never</em> existed under the Jewish Dispensation
            at all, and I cannot but regard it as an aspersion on the
            character of Him who is "glorious in Holiness" for any one to assert
            that "<em>God sanctioned, yea commanded slavery</em> under the old dispensation."
            I would fain lift my feeble voice to vindicate Jehovah's
            character from so foul a slander. If slaveholders are determined to
            hold slaves as long as they can, let them not dare to say that the
            God of mercy and of truth <em>ever</em> sanctioned such a system of cruelty
            and wrong. It is blasphemy against Him.

         </p>
         <p>
            We have seen that the code of laws framed by Moses with regard
            to servants was designed to <em>protect them</em> as <em>men and women</em>, to secure
            to them their <em>rights</em> as <em>human beings</em>, to guard them from oppression
            and defend them from violence of every kind. Let us now turn to
            the Slave laws of the South and West and examine them too. I will
            give you the substance only, because I fear I shall trespass too
            much on your time, were I to quote them at length.

         </p>
         <p>
            1. <em>Slavery</em> is hereditary and perpetual, to the last moment of the
            slave's earthly existence, and to all his descendants to the latest posterity.

         </p>
         <p>
            2. The labor of the slave is compulsory and uncompensated;
            while the kind of labor, the amount of toil, the time allowed for rest,
            are dictated solely by the master. No bargain is made, no wages
            given. A pure despotism governs the human brute; and even his
            covering and provender, both as to quantity and quality, depend entirely
            on the master's discretion<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE2_FN3"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE2_FN3"></a>.

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE2_FN3"></a><a href="#FootE2_FN3">A</a>: There are laws in some of
            the slave states, limiting the labor which the master
            may require of the slave to fourteen hours daily. In some of
            the states there are laws requiring the masters to furnish a certain
            amount of food and clothing, as for instance, <em>one quart</em>
            of corn per day, or <em>one peck</em> per week, or <em>one
               bushel</em> per month, and "one linen shirt and pantaloons for
            the summer, and a linen shirt and woolen great coat and pantaloons
            for the winter," &amp;c. But "still," to use the language of
            Judge Stroud "the slave is entirely under the control of his
            master,&#8212;is unprovided with a protector,&#8212;and, especially as
            he cannot be a witness or make complaint in any known mode against his
            master, the apparent object of these laws may <em>always</em>
            be defeated." ED.
         </p>
         <p>
            3. The slave being considered a personal chattel may be sold or
            pledged, or leased at the will of his master. He may be exchanged
            for marketable commodities, or taken in execution for the debts or
            taxes either of a living or dead master. Sold at auction, either individually,
            or in lots to suit the purchaser, he may remain with his
            family, or be separated from them for ever.

         </p>
         <p>
            4. Slaves can make no contracts and have no <em>legal</em> right to any
            property, real or personal. Their own honest earnings and the legacies
            of friends belong in point of law to their masters.

         </p>
         <p>
            5. Neither a slave nor a free colored person can be a witness

            against any <em>white</em>, or free person, in a court of justice, however atrocious
            may have been the crimes they have seen him commit, if such
            testimony would be for the benefit of a <em>slave</em>; but they may give testimony
            <em>against a fellow slave</em>, or free colored man, even in cases
            affecting life, if the <em>master</em> is to reap the advantage of it.

         </p>
         <p>
            6. The slave may be punished at his master's discretion&#8212;without
            trial&#8212;without any means of legal redress; whether his offence be
            real or imaginary; and the master can transfer the same despotic
            power to any person or persons, he may choose to appoint.

         </p>
         <p>
            7. The slave is not allowed to resist any free man under <em>any</em> circumstances,
            <em>his</em> only safety consists in the fact that his <em>owner</em> may
            bring suit and recover the price of his body, in case his life is taken,
            or his limbs rendered unfit for labor.

         </p>
         <p>
            8. Slaves cannot redeem themselves, or obtain a change of masters,
            though cruel treatment may have rendered such a change necessary
            for their personal safety.

         </p>
         <p>
            9. The slave is entirely unprotected in his domestic relations.

         </p>
         <p>
            10. The laws greatly obstruct the manumission of slaves, even
            where the master is willing to enfranchise them.

         </p>
         <p>
            11. The operation of the laws tends to deprive slaves of religious
            instruction and consolation.

         </p>
         <p>
            12. The whole power of the laws is exerted to keep slaves in a
            state of the lowest ignorance.

         </p>
         <p>
            13. There is in this country a monstrous inequality of law and
            right. What is a trifling fault in the <em>white</em> man, is considered highly
            criminal in the <em>slave</em>; the same offences which cost a white man a
            few dollars only, are punished in the negro with death.

         </p>
         <p>
            14. The laws operate most oppressively upon free people of color<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE2_FN4"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE2_FN4"></a>.

            Shall I ask you now my friends, to draw the <em>parallel</em> between Jewish
            <em>servitude</em> and American <em>slavery</em>? No! For there is <em>no likeness</em>
            in the two systems; I ask you rather to mark the contrast. The
            laws of Moses <em>protected servants</em> in their <em>rights as men and women</em>,
            guarded them from oppression and defended them from wrong. The
            Code Noir of the South <em>robs the slave of all his rights</em> as a <em>man</em>, reduces
            him to a chattel personal, and defends the <em>master</em> in the exercise
            of the most unnatural and unwarrantable power over his slave.
            They each bear the impress of the hand which formed them. The
            attributes of justice and mercy are shadowed out in the Hebrew
            code; those of injustice and cruelty, in the Code Noir of America.
            Truly it was wise in the slaveholders of the South to declare their
            slaves to be "chattels personal;" for before they could be robbed
            of wages, wives, children, and friends, it was absolutely necessary to
            deny they were human beings. It is wise in them, to keep them in
            abject ignorance, for the strong man armed must be bound before we
            can spoil his house&#8212;the powerful intellect of man must be bound
            down with the iron chains of nescience before we can rob him of his
            rights as a man; we must reduce him to a <em>thing</em>; before we can claim

            the right to set our feet upon his neck, because it was only <em>all things</em>
            which were originally <em>put under the feet of man</em> by the Almighty and
            Beneficent Father of all, who has declared himself to be <em>no respecter</em>
            of persons, whether red, white, or black.

         </p>
         <p>
            But some have even said that Jesus Christ did not condemn slavery.
            To this I reply, that our Holy Redeemer lived and preached among
            the Jews only. The laws which Moses had enacted fifteen hundred
            years previous to his appearance among them, had never been annulled,
            and these laws <em>protected</em> every servant in Palestine. That he saw
            nothing of <em>perpetual</em> servitude is certain from the simple declaration
            made by himself in John, viii, 35. "The servant abideth <em>not</em> in the
            house for ever, the son abideth ever." If then He did not condemn
            Jewish <em>temporary</em> servitude, this does not prove that he would not
            have condemned such a monstrous system as that of AMERICAN <em>slavery</em>,
            if that had existed among them. But did not Jesus condemn slavery?
            Let us examine some of his precepts. "<em>Whatsoever</em> ye would that
            men should do to you, do <em>ye even so to them</em>." Let every slaveholder
            apply these queries to his own heart; Am <em>I</em> willing to be a slave&#8212;Am
            <em>I</em> willing to see <em>my</em> husband the slave of another&#8212;Am <em>I</em> willing to see
            my mother a slave, or my father, my <em>white</em> sister, or my <em>white</em> brother?
            If <em>not</em>, then in holding others as slaves, I am doing what I would <em>not</em>
            wish to be done to me or any relative I have; and thus have I broken
            this golden rule which was given <em>me</em> to walk by.

         </p>
         <p>
            But some slaveholders have said, "we were never in bondage to any
            man," and therefore the yoke of bondage would be insufferable to us,
            but slaves are accustomed to it, their backs are fitted to the burden.
            Well, I am willing to admit that you who have lived in freedom would
            find slavery even more oppressive than the poor slave does, but then
            you may try this question in another form&#8212;Am I willing to reduce
            <em>my little child</em> to slavery? You know that <em>if it is brought up a slave</em>, it
            will never know any contrast between freedom and bondage; its back
            will become fitted to the burden just as the negro child's does&#8212;<em>not by
               nature</em>&#8212;but by daily, violent pressure, in the same way that the head
            of the Indian child becomes flattened by the boards in which it is
            bound. It has been justly remarked that "<em>God never made a slave</em>," he
            made man upright; his back was <em>not</em> made to carry burdens as the
            slave of another, nor his neck to wear a yoke, and the <em>man</em> must be
            crushed within him, before <em>his</em> back can be <em>fitted</em> to the burden of perpetual
            slavery; and that his back is <em>not</em> fitted to it, is manifest by the
            insurrections that so often disturb the peace and security of
            slave-holding
            countries. Who ever heard of a rebellion of the beasts of the
            field; and why not? simply because <em>they</em> were all placed <em>under the feet
               of man</em>, into whose hand they were delivered; it was originally designed
            that they should serve him, therefore their necks have been
            formed for the yoke, and their backs for the burden; but <em>not so with
               man</em>, intellectual, immortal man! I appeal to you, my friends, as
            mothers; Are you willing to enslave <em>your</em> children? You start back
            with horror and indignation at such a question. But why, if slavery
            is <em>no wrong</em> to those upon whom it is imposed? why, if, as has often
            been said, slaves are happier than their masters, freer from the cares
            and perplexities of providing for themselves and their families? why
            not place <em>your children</em> in the way of being supported without your
            having the trouble to provide for them, or they for themselves? Do
            you not perceive that as soon as this golden rule of action is applied to
            <em>yourselves</em>, that you involuntarily shrink from the test; as soon as <em>your</em>
            actions are weighed in <em>this</em> balance of the sanctuary, that <em>you are found wanting?</em>
            Try yourselves by another of the
            Divine precepts, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Can
            we love a man <em>as</em> we love <em>ourselves</em> if we do, and continue to do unto
            him, what we would not wish any one to do to us? Look too, at
            Christ's example, what does he say of himself, "I came <em>not</em> to be
            ministered unto, but to minister." Can you for a moment imagine
            the meek, and lowly, and compassionate Saviour, a <em>slaveholder</em>? do
            you not shudder at this thought as much as at that of his being a <em>warrior</em>?
            But why, if slavery is not sinful?

         </p>
         <p>
            Again, it has been said, the Apostle Paul did not condemn Slavery,
            for he sent Onesimus back to Philemon. I do not think it can be
            said he sent him back, for no coercion was made use of. Onesimus
            was not thrown into prison and then sent back in chains to his master,
            as your runaway slaves often are&#8212;this could not possibly have been
            the case, because you know Paul as a Jew, was <em>bound to protect</em> the
            runaway, <em>he had no right</em> to send any fugitive back to his master.
            The state of the case then seems to have been this. Onesimus had
            been an unprofitable servant to Philemon and left him&#8212;he afterwards
            became converted under the Apostle's preaching, and seeing that he
            had been to blame in his conduct, and desiring by future fidelity to
            atone for past error, he wished to return, and the Apostle gave him
            the letter we now have as a recommendation to Philemon, informing
            him of the conversion of Onesimus, and entreating him as "Paul the
            aged to receive him, <em>not</em> now as a <em>servant</em>, but <em>above</em> a servant, a
            brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more unto thee,
            both in the flesh and in the Lord. If thou count <em>me</em> therefore as a
            partner, <em>receive him as myself.</em>" This then surely cannot be forced
            into a justification of the practice of returning runaway slaves back
            to their masters, to be punished with cruel beatings and scourgings
            as they often are. Besides the word [Greek: doulos] here translated servant,
            is the same that is made use of in Matt. xviii, 27. Now it appears
            that this servant owed his lord ten thousand talents; he possessed
            property to a vast amount. Onesimus could not then have been a
            <em>slave</em>, for slaves do not own their wives, or children; no, not even
            their own bodies, much less property. But again, the servitude which
            the apostle was accustomed to, must have been very different from
            American slavery, for he says, "the heir (or son), as long as he is a
            child, differeth <em>nothing from a servant</em>, though he be lord of all. But
            is under <em>tutors</em> and governors until the time appointed of the father."
            From this it appears, that the means of <em>instruction</em> were provided for
            <em>servants</em> as well as children; and indeed we know it must have been
            so among the Jews, because their servants were not permitted to
            remain in perpetual bondage, and therefore it was absolutely necessary
            they should be prepared to occupy higher stations in society

            than those of servants. Is it so at the South, my friends? Is the
            daily bread of instruction provided for <em>your slaves</em>? are their minds
            enlightened, and they gradually prepared to rise from the grade of
            menials into that of <em>free</em>, independent members of the state? Let
            your own statute book, and your own daily experience, answer these
            questions.

         </p>
         <p>
            If this apostle sanctioned <em>slavery</em>, why did he exhort masters thus
            in his epistle to the Ephesians, "and ye, masters, do the same things
            unto them (i.e. perform your duties to your servants as unto Christ,
            not unto me) <em>forbearing threatening</em>; knowing that your master also
            is in heaven, neither is <em>there respect of persons with him</em>." And in
            Colossians, "Masters give unto your servants that which is <em>just and
               equal</em>, knowing that ye also have a master in heaven." Let slaveholders
            only <em>obey</em> these injunctions of Paul, and I am satisfied slavery
            would soon be abolished. If he thought it sinful even to <em>threaten</em>
            servants, surely he must have thought it sinful to flog and to beat
            them with sticks and paddles; indeed, when delineating the character
            of a bishop, he expressly names this as one feature of it, "<em>no striker</em>."
            Let masters give unto their servants that which is <em>just</em> and <em>equal</em>, and
            all that vast system of unrequited labor would crumble into ruin.
            Yes, and if they once felt they had no right to the <em>labor</em> of their servants
            without pay, surely they could not think they had a right to
            their wives, their children, and their own bodies. Again, how can it
            be said Paul sanctioned slavery, when, as though to put this matter
            beyond all doubt, in that black catalogue of sins enumerated in his
            first epistle to Timothy, he mentions "<em>menstealers</em>," which word may
            be translated "<em>slavedealers</em>." But you may say, we all despise slavedealers
            as much as any one can; they are never admitted into genteel
            or respectable society. And why not? Is it not because even you
            shrink back from the idea of associating with those who make their
            fortunes by trading in the bodies and souls of men, women, and children?
            whose daily work it is to break human hearts, by tearing wives
            from their husbands, and children from their parents? But why hold
            slavedealers as despicable, if their trade is lawful and virtuous? and
            why despise them more than the <em>gentlemen of fortune and standing</em>
            who employ them as <em>their</em> agents? Why more than the <em>professors of
               religion</em> who barter their fellow-professors to them for gold and silver?
            We do not despise the land agent, or the physician, or the merchant,
            and why? Simply because their professions are virtuous and honorable;
            and if the trade of men-jobbers was honorable, you would not
            despise them either. There is no difference in <em>principle</em>, in <em>Christian
               ethics</em>, between the despised slavedealer and the <em>Christian</em> who buys
            slaves from, or sells slaves to him; indeed, if slaves were not wanted
            by the respectable, the wealthy, and the religious in a community,
            there would be no slaves in that community, and of course no <em>slavedealers</em>.
            It is then the <em>Christians</em> and the <em>honorable men</em> and <em>women</em>
            of the South, who are the <em>main pillars</em> of this grand temple built to
            Mammon and to Moloch. It is the <em>most enlightened</em> in every country
            who are <em>most</em> to blame when any public sin is supported by public

            opinion, hence Isaiah says, "<em>When</em> the Lord hath performed his
            whole work upon mount <em>Zion</em> and on <em>Jerusalem</em>, (then) I will punish
            the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his
            high looks." And was it not so? Open the historical records of
            that age, was not Israel carried into captivity B.C. 606, Judah B.C.
            588, and the stout heart of the heathen monarchy not punished until
            B.C. 536, fifty-two years <em>after</em> Judah's, and seventy years <em>after</em>
            Israel's captivity, when it was overthrown by Cyrus, king of Persia?
            Hence, too, the apostle Peter says, "judgment must <em>begin at the
               house of God</em>." Surely this would not be the case, if the <em>professors of
               religion</em> were not <em>most worthy</em> of blame.

         </p>
         <p>
            But it may be asked, why are <em>they</em> most culpable? I will tell you,
            my friends. It is because sin is imputed to us just in proportion to
            the spiritual light we receive. Thus the prophet Amos says, in the
            name of Jehovah, "<em>You only</em> have I known of all the families of the
            earth: <em>therefore</em> I will punish you for all your iniquities."
            Hear too
            the doctrine of our Lord on this important subject; "The servant
            who <em>knew</em> his Lord's will and <em>prepared not</em> himself, neither did according
            to his will, shall be beaten with <em>many</em> stripes": and why?
            "For unto whomsoever <em>much</em> is given, <em>of him</em> shall <em>much</em> be required;
            and to whom men have committed <em>much</em>, of <em>him</em> they will ask the
            <em>more</em>." Oh! then that the <em>Christians</em> of the south would ponder these
            things in their hearts, and awake to the vast responsibilities which
            rest <em>upon them</em> at this important crisis.

         </p>
         <p>
            I have thus, I think, clearly proved to you seven propositions, viz.:
            First, that slavery is contrary to the declaration of our independence.
            Second, that it is contrary to the first charter of human rights given
            to Adam, and renewed to Noah. Third, that the fact of slavery
            having been the subject of prophecy, furnishes <em>no</em> excuse whatever to
            slavedealers. Fourth, that no such system existed under the patriarchal
            dispensation. Fifth, that <em>slavery never</em> existed under the Jewish
            dispensation; but so far otherwise, that every servant was placed
            under the <em>protection of law</em>, and care taken not only to prevent all
            <em>involuntary</em> servitude, but all <em>voluntary perpetual</em> bondage. Sixth,
            that slavery in America reduces a <em>man</em> to a <em>thing</em>, a
            "chattel personal," <em>robs him</em> of <em>all</em> his rights as a <em>human being</em>, fetters both his
            mind and body, and protects the <em>master</em> in the most unnatural and
            unreasonable power, whilst it <em>throws him out</em> of the protection of law.
            Seventh, that slavery is contrary to the example and precepts of our
            holy and merciful Redeemer, and of his apostles.

         </p>
         <p>
            But perhaps you will be ready to query, why appeal to <em>women</em> on
            this subject? <em>We</em> do not make the laws which perpetuate slavery.
            <em>No</em> legislative power is vested in <em>us</em>; <em>we</em> can do nothing to overthrow
            the system, even if we wished to do so. To this I reply, I
            know you do not make the laws, but I also know that <em>you are the wives
               and mothers, the sisters and daughters of those who do</em>; and if you really
            suppose <em>you</em> can do nothing to overthrow slavery, you are greatly
            mistaken. You can do much in every way: four things I will name.
            1st. You can read on this subject. 2d. You can pray over this subject.

            3d. You can speak on this subject. 4th. You can <em>act</em> on this
            subject. I have not placed reading before praying because I regard
            it more important, but because, in order to pray aright, we must understand
            what we are praying for; it is only then we can "pray with
            the understanding and the spirit also."

         </p>
         <p>
            1. Read then on the subject of slavery. Search the Scriptures
            daily, whether the things I have told you are true. Other books and
            papers might be a great help to you to this investigation, but they are
            not necessary, and it is hardly probable that your Committees of Vigilance
            will allow you to have any other. The <em>Bible</em> then is the book
            I want you to read in the spirit of inquiry, and the spirit of prayer.
            Even the enemies of Abolitionists, acknowledge that their doctrines
            are drawn from it. In the great mob in Boston, last autumn, when
            the books and papers of the Anti-Slavery Society, were thrown out
            of the windows of their office, one individual laid hold of the Bible
            and was about tossing it out to the ground, when another reminded
            him that it was the Bible he had in his hand. "O! <em>'tis all one</em>,"
            he replied, and out went the sacred volume, along with the rest. We
            thank him for the acknowledgment. Yes, "<em>it is all one</em>," for our
            books and papers are mostly commentaries on the Bible, and the
            Declaration. Read the <em>Bible </em>then, it contains the
            words of Jesus,
            and they are spirit and life. Judge for yourselves
            whether <em>he sanctioned</em> such a system of oppression and crime.

         </p>
         <p>
            2. Pray over this subject. When you have entered into your
            closets, and shut to the doors, then pray to your father, who seeth in
            secret, that he would open your eyes to see whether slavery
            is <em>sinful</em>, and if it is, that he would enable you to
            bear a faithful, open and un-shrinking
            testimony against it, and to do whatsoever your hands find
            to do, leaving the consequences entirely to him, who still says to us
            whenever we try to reason away duty from the fear of consequences,
            "<em>What is that to thee, follow thou me</em>." Pray also for that
            poor slave, that he may be kept patient and submissive under his hard lot,
            until God is pleased to open the door of freedom to him without violence
            or bloodshed. Pray too for the master that his heart may be softened,
            and he made willing to acknowledge, as Joseph's brethren did, "Verily
            we are guilty concerning our brother," before he will be compelled to
            add in consequence of Divine judgment, "therefore is all this evil
            come upon us." Pray also for all your brethren and sisters who are
            laboring in the righteous cause of Emancipation in the Northern
            States, England and the world. There is great encouragement for
            prayer in these words of our Lord. "Whatsoever ye shall ask the
            Father in my name, he will give it to you"&#8212;Pray then without ceasing,
            in the closet and the social circle.

         </p>
         <p>
            3. Speak on this subject. It is through the tongue, the pen, and
            the press, that truth is principally propagated. Speak then to your
            relatives, your friends, your acquaintances on the subject of slavery;
            be not afraid if you are conscientiously convinced it is <em>sinful</em>,
            to say so openly, but calmly, and to let your sentiments be known. If you
            are served by the slaves of others, try to ameliorate their condition as

            much as possible; never aggravate their faults, and thus add fuel to
            the fire of anger already kindled, in a master and mistress's bosom;
            remember their extreme ignorance, and consider them as your Heavenly
            Father does the <em>less</em> culpable on this account, even when they
            do wrong things. Discountenance <em>all</em> cruelty to them, all
            starvation, all corporal chastisement; these may brutalize and
            <em>break</em> their spirits,
            but will never bend them to willing, cheerful obedience. If possible,
            see that they are comfortably and
            <em>seasonably</em> fed, whether in the house
            or the field; it is unreasonable and cruel to expect slaves to wait for
            their breakfast until eleven o'clock, when they rise at five or six. Do
            all you can, to induce their owners to clothe them well, and to allow
            them many little indulgences which would contribute to their comfort.
            Above all, try to persuade your husband, father, brothers and sons,
            that <em>slavery is a crime against God and man</em>, and that it
            is a great sin to keep <em>human beings</em> in such abject
            ignorance; to deny them the privilege of learning to read and write.
            The Catholics are universally condemned, for denying the Bible to the
            common people, but, <em>slaveholders must not</em> blame them,
            for <em>they</em> are doing the <em>very same
               thing</em>, and for the very same reason, neither of these systems can
            bear the light which bursts from the pages of that Holy Book. And
            lastly, endeavour to inculcate submission on the part of the slaves,
            but whilst doing this be faithful in pleading the cause of the oppressed.

         <p>
            4. Act on this subject. Some of you <em>own</em> slaves yourselves. If
            you believe slavery is <em>sinful</em>, set them at liberty, "undo
            the heavy burdens and let the oppressed go free." If they wish to remain with
            you, pay them wages, if not let them leave you. Should they remain
            teach them, and have them taught the common branches of an English
            education; they have minds and those minds, <em>ought to be improved</em>.
            So precious a talent as intellect, never was given to be wrapt in a
            napkin and buried in the earth. It is the <em>duty</em> of all, as
            far as they can, to improve their own mental faculties, because we are
            commanded to love God with <em>all our minds</em>, as well as with
            all our hearts, and we commit a great sin, if we <em>forbid
               or prevent</em> that cultivation of the mind in others, which would enable
            them to perform this duty.
            Teach your servants then to read &amp;c., and encourage them to believe
            it is their <em>duty</em> to learn, if it were only
            that they might read the Bible.

         </p>
         <p>
            But some of you will say, we can neither free our slaves nor teach
            them to read, for the laws of our state forbid it. Be not surprised
            when I say such wicked laws <em>ought to be no barrier</em> in the way of
            your duty, and I appeal to the Bible to prove this position. What
            was the conduct of Shiphrah and Puah, when the king of Egypt
            issued his cruel mandate, with regard to the Hebrew children?
            "<em>They</em> feared <em>God</em>, and did <em>not</em> as
            the King of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive." Did
            these <em>women</em> do right

            in disobeying that monarch? "<em>Therefore</em> (says the sacred text,)
            <em>God dealt well</em> with them, and made them houses" Ex. i. What
            was the conduct of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, when Nebuchadnezzar
            set up a golden image in the plain of Dura, and commanded all
            people, nations, and languages, to fall down and worship it? "Be it
            known, unto thee, (said these faithful <em>Jews</em>) O king, that
            <em>we will not</em> serve thy gods, nor worship the image which thou
            hast set up." Did these men <em>do right in disobeying the law</em> of
            their sovereign? Let their miraculous deliverance from the burning fiery
            furnace, answer; Dan. iii. What was the conduct of Daniel, when Darius
            made a firm decree that no one should ask a petition of any man or God
            for thirty days? Did the prophet cease to pray? No! "When Daniel
            <em>knew that the writing was signed</em>, he went into his house,
            and his windows being <em>open</em> towards Jerusalem, he kneeled
            upon his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave thanks before his
            God, as he did aforetime."
            Did Daniel do right thus to <em>break</em> the law of his king? Let
            his wonderful deliverance out of the mouths of the lions answer;
            Dan. vii. Look, too, at the Apostles Peter and John. When the
            rulers of the Jews, "<em>commanded them not</em> to speak at all,
            nor teach in the name of Jesus," what did they say? "Whether it be right in
            the sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge
            ye." And what did they do? "They spake the word of God with
            boldness, and with great power gave the Apostles witness of the
            <em>resurrection</em> of the Lord Jesus;" although <em>this</em>
            was the very doctrine, for the preaching of which, they had just been
            cast into prison, and further threatened. Did these men do right? I leave
            <em>you</em> to answer,
            who now enjoy the benefits of their labors and sufferings, in that
            Gospel they dared to preach when positively commanded
            <em>not to teach any more</em> in the name of Jesus; Acts iv.

         </p>
         <p>
            But some of you may say, if we do free our slaves, they will be
            taken up and sold, therefore there will be no use in doing it. Peter
            and John might just as well have said, we will not preach the gospel,
            for if we do, we shall be taken up and put in prison, therefore there
            will be no use in our preaching. <em>Consequences</em>, my friends,
            belong no more to <em>you</em>, than they did to these apostles.
            Duty is ours and events are God's. If you think slavery is sinful,
            all <em>you</em> have to do is to set
            your slaves at liberty, do all you can to protect them, and in humble
            faith and fervent prayer, commend them to your common Father.
            He can take care of them; but if for wise purposes he sees fit to
            allow them to be sold, this will afford you an opportunity of testifying
            openly, wherever you go, against the crime of <em>manstealing</em>. Such
            an act will be <em>clear robbery</em>, and if exposed, might, under
            the Divine direction, do the cause of Emancipation more good, than any thing
            that could happen, for, "He makes even the wrath of man to praise
            him, and the remainder of wrath he will restrain."

         </p>
         <p>
            I know that this doctrine of obeying <em>God</em>, rather than man,
            will be considered as dangerous, and heretical by many, but I am not afraid
            openly to avow it, because it is the doctrine of the Bible; but I would
            not be understood to advocate resistance to any law however oppressive,

            if, in obeying it, I was not obliged to commit <em>sin</em>. If for
            instance, there was a law, which imposed imprisonment or a fine
            upon me if I manumitted a slave, I would on no account resist that
            law, I would set the slave free, and then go to prison or pay the fine.
            If a law commands me to <em>sin I will break it</em>; if it calls
            me to <em>suffer</em>, I will let it take its course
            <em>unresistingly</em>. The doctrine of blind obedience
            and unqualified submission to <em>any human</em> power,
            whether civil or ecclesiastical, is the doctrine of despotism, and ought
            to have no place among Republicans and Christians.

         </p>
         <p>
            But you will perhaps say, such a course of conduct would inevitably
            expose us to great suffering. Yes! my christian friends, I believe
            it would, but this will <em>not</em> excuse you or any one else for the
            neglect of <em>duty</em>. If Prophets and Apostles, Martyrs, and Reformers
            had not been willing to suffer for the truth's sake, where would the
            world have been now? If they had said, we cannot speak the truth,
            we cannot do what we believe is right, because the <em>laws of our country
               or public opinion are against us</em>, where would our holy religion have
            been now? The Prophets were stoned, imprisoned, and killed by
            the Jews. And why? Because they exposed and openly rebuked
            public sins; they opposed public opinion; had they held their peace,
            they all might have lived in ease and died in favor with a wicked generation.
            Why were the Apostles persecuted from city to city, stoned,
            incarcerated, beaten, and crucified? Because they dared to <em>speak the
               truth</em>; to tell the Jews, boldly and fearlessly,
            that <em>they</em> were the <em>murderers</em>
            of the Lord of Glory, and that, however great a stumbling-block
            the Cross might be to them, there was no other name given
            under heaven by which men could be saved, but the name of Jesus.
            Because they declared, even at Athens, the seat of learning and refinement,
            the self-evident truth, that "they be no gods that are made
            with men's hands," and exposed to the Grecians the foolishness of
            worldly wisdom, and the impossibility of salvation but through Christ,
            whom they despised on account of the ignominious death he died.
            Because at Rome, the proud mistress of the world, they thundered
            out the terrors of the law upon that idolatrous, war-making, and
            slave-holding community. Why were the martyrs stretched upon the
            rack, gibbetted and burnt, the scorn and diversion of a Nero, whilst
            their tarred and burning bodies sent up a light which illuminated the
            Roman capital? Why were the Waldenses hunted like wild beasts
            upon the mountains of Piedmont, and slain with the sword of the
            Duke of Savoy and the proud monarch of France? Why were the
            Presbyterians chased like the partridge over the highlands of Scotland&#8212;the
            Methodists pumped, and stoned, and pelted with rotten
            eggs&#8212;the Quakers incarcerated in filthy prisons, beaten, whipped at
            the cart's tail, banished and hung? Because they dared to <em>speak</em>
            the <em>truth</em>, to <em>break</em> the unrighteous <em>laws</em> of their country, and chose rather
            to suffer affliction with the people of God, "not accepting deliverance,"
            even under the gallows. Why were Luther and Calvin persecuted
            and excommunicated, Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer burnt?
            Because they fearlessly proclaimed the truth, though that truth was

            contrary to public opinion, and the authority of Ecclesiastical councils
            and conventions. Now all this vast amount of human suffering
            might have been saved. All these Prophets and Apostles, Martyrs,
            and Reformers, might have lived and died in peace with all men, but
            following the example of their great pattern, "they despised the
            shame, endured the cross, and are now set down on the right hand
            of the throne of God," having received the glorious welcome of "well
            <em>done</em> good and faithful servants, enter ye into the joy
            of your Lord."

         </p>
         <p>
            But you may say we are <em>women</em>, how can <em>our</em> hearts
            endure persecution? And why not? Have not <em>women</em> stood up in
            all the dignity and strength of moral courage to be the leaders of the
            people, and to bear a faithful testimony for the truth whenever the
            providence of God has called them to do so? Are there no
            <em>women</em> in that noble
            army of martyrs who are now singing the song of Moses and the
            Lamb? Who led out the women of Israel from the house of bondage,
            striking the timbrel, and singing the song of deliverance on the
            banks of that sea whose waters stood up like walls of crystal to open
            a passage for their escape? It was a <em>woman</em>; Miriam, the
            prophetess, the sister of Moses and Aaron. Who went up with Barak to
            Kadesh to fight against Jabin, King of Canaan, into whose hand
            Israel had been sold because of their iniquities? It was a <em>woman!</em>
            Deborah the wife of Lapidoth, the judge, as well as the prophetess
            of that backsliding people; Judges iv, 9. Into whose hands was
            Sisera, the captain of Jabin's host delivered? Into the hand of a
            <em>woman</em>. Jael the wife of Heber! Judges vi, 21. Who dared to
            <em>speak the truth</em> concerning those judgments which were coming upon
            Judea, when Josiah, alarmed at finding that his people "had not kept
            the word of the Lord to do after all that was written in the book of
            the Law," sent to enquire of the Lord concerning these things? It
            was a <em>woman</em>. Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum; 2,
            Chron. xxxiv, 22. Who was chosen to deliver the whole Jewish
            nation from that murderous decree of Persia's King, which wicked
            Haman had obtained by calumny and fraud? It was a <em>woman</em>;
            Esther the Queen; yes, weak and trembling <em>woman</em> was the
            instrument appointed by God, to reverse the bloody mandate of the eastern
            monarch, and save the <em>whole visible church</em> from destruction. What
            human voice first proclaimed to Mary that she should be the mother
            of our Lord? It was a <em>woman!</em> Elizabeth, the wife of Zacharias;
            Luke i, 42, 43. Who united with the good old Simeon in giving
            thanks publicly in the temple, when the child, Jesus, was presented
            there by his parents, "and spake of him to all them that looked for
            redemption in Jerusalem?" It was a <em>woman!</em> Anna the prophetess.
            Who first proclaimed Christ as the true Messiah in the streets of Samaria,
            once the capital of the ten tribes? It was a <em>woman!</em> Who
            ministered to the Son of God whilst on earth, a despised and persecuted
            Reformer, in the humble garb of a carpenter? They were
            <em>women!</em> Who followed the rejected King of Israel, as his fainting
            footsteps trod the road to Calvary? "A great company of people
            and of <em>women</em>;" and it is remarkable that to
            <em>them alone</em>, he turned

            and addressed the pathetic language, "Daughters of Jerusalem,
            weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and your children." Ah!
            who sent unto the Roman Governor when he was set down on the
            judgment seat, saying unto him, "Have thou nothing to do with that
            just man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because
            of him?" It was a <em>woman</em>! the wife of Pilate. Although
            "<em>he knew</em> that for envy the Jews had delivered Christ," yet
            <em>he</em> consented
            to surrender the Son of God into the hands of a brutal soldiery,
            after having himself scourged his naked body. Had the <em>wife</em> of
            Pilate sat upon that judgment seat, what would have been the result
            of the trial of this "just person?"

         </p>
         <p>
            And who last hung round the cross of Jesus on the mountain
            of Golgotha? Who first visited the sepulchre early in the morning
            on the first day of the week, carrying sweet spices to embalm his
            precious body, not knowing that it was incorruptible and could not
            be holden by the bands of death? These were <em>women</em>! To whom
            did he <em>first</em> appear after his resurrection? It was to
            a <em>woman</em>! Mary
            Magdalene; Mark xvi, 9. Who gathered with the apostles to wait
            at Jerusalem, in prayer and supplication, for "the promise of the
            Father;" the spiritual blessing of the Great High Priest of his
            Church, who had entered, <em>not</em> into the splendid temple of Solomon,
            there to offer the blood of bulls, and of goats, and the smoking censer
            upon the golden altar, but into Heaven itself, there to present his
            intercessions,
            after having "given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice
            to God for a sweet smelling savor?" <em>Women</em> were among that
            holy company; Acts i, 14. And did <em>women</em> wait in vain? Did
            those who had ministered to his necessities, followed in his train, and
            wept at his crucifixion, wait in vain? No! No! Did the cloven
            tongues of fire descend upon the heads of <em>women</em> as well as men?
            Yes, my friends, "it sat upon <em>each one of them</em>;" Acts ii, 3.
            <em>women</em> as well as men were to be living stones in the temple
            of grace, and therefore <em>their</em> heads were consecrated by
            the descent of the Holy Ghost as well as those of men.
            Were <em>women</em> recognized as
            fellow laborers in the gospel field? They were! Paul says in his
            epistle to the Philippians, "help those <em>women</em> who labored
            with me, in the gospel;" Phil. iv, 3.

         </p>
         <p>
            But this is not all. Roman <em>women</em> were burnt at the stake,
            <em>their</em>
            delicate limbs were torn joint from joint by the ferocious beasts of the
            Amphitheatre, and tossed by the wild bull in his fury, for the diversion
            of that idolatrous, warlike, and slaveholding people. Yes,
            <em>women</em> suffered
            under the ten persecutions of heathen Rome, with the most unshrinking
            constancy and fortitude; not all the entreaties of friends,
            nor the claims of new born infancy, nor the cruel threats of enemies
            could make <em>them</em> sprinkle one grain of incense upon the altars
            of Roman idols. Come now with me to the beautiful valleys of Piedmont.
            Whose blood stains the green sward, and decks the wild flowers with
            colors not their own, and smokes on the sword of persecuting France?
            It is <em>woman's</em>, as well as man's? Yes, <em>women</em> were
            accounted as sheep
            for the slaughter, and were cut down as the tender saplings of the wood.

         </p>
         <p>
            But time would fail me, to tell of all those hundreds and thousands
            of <em>women</em>, who perished in the Low countries of Holland,
            when Alva's
            sword of vengeance was unsheathed against the Protestants, when
            the Catholic Inquisitions of Europe became the merciless executioners
            of vindictive wrath, upon those who dared to worship God, instead
            of bowing down in unholy adoration before "my Lord God the
            <em>Pope</em>,"
            and when England, too, burnt her Ann Ascoes at the stake of martyrdom.
            Suffice it to say, that the Church, after having been driven from
            Judea to Rome, and from Rome to Piedmont, and from Piedmont to
            England, and from England to Holland, at last stretched her fainting
            wings over the dark bosom of the Atlantic, and found on the shores
            of a great wilderness, a refuge from tyranny and oppression&#8212;as she
            thought, but <em>even here</em>, (the warm blush of shame mantles
            my cheek as I write it,) <em>even here, woman</em> was beaten and
            banished, imprisoned, and hung upon the gallows, a trophy to the Cross.

         </p>
         <p>
            And what, I would ask in conclusion, have <em>women</em> done
            for the great and glorious cause of Emancipation? Who wrote that pamphlet
            which moved the heart of Wilberforce to pray over the wrongs, and his
            tongue to plead the cause of the oppressed African? It was
            a <em>woman</em>, Elizabeth Heyrick. Who labored assiduously to keep
            the sufferings of the slave continually before the British public? They were
            <em>women</em>.
            And how did they do it? By their needles, paint brushes and pens,
            by speaking the truth, and petitioning Parliament for the abolition of
            slavery. And what was the effect of their labors? Read it in the
            Emancipation bill of Great Britain. Read it, in the present state of
            her West India Colonies. Read it, in the impulse which has been
            given to the cause of freedom, in the United States of America.
            Have English women then done so much for the negro, and shall
            American women do nothing? Oh no! Already are there sixty female
            Anti-Slavery Societies in operation. These are doing just what the
            English women did, telling the story of the colored man's wrongs,
            praying for his deliverance, and presenting his kneeling image constantly
            before the public eye on bags and needle-books, card-racks,
            pen-wipers, pin-cushions, &amp;c. Even the children of the north are inscribing
            on their handy work, "May the points of our needles prick
            the slaveholder's conscience." Some of the reports of these Societies
            exhibit not only considerable talent, but a deep sense of religious
            duty, and a determination to persevere through evil as well as good
            report, until every scourge, and every shackle, is buried under the
            feet of the manumitted slave.

         </p>
         <p>
            The Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society of Boston was called last fall, to a
            severe trial of their faith and constancy. They were mobbed by "the
            gentlemen of property and standing," in that city at their anniversary
            meeting, and their lives were jeoparded by an infuriated crowd; but
            their conduct on that occasion did credit to our sex, and affords a full
            assurance that they will <em>never</em> abandon the cause of the
            slave. The pamphlet, Right and Wrong in Boston, issued by them in which a
            particular account is given of that "mob of broad cloth in broad day,"
            does equal credit to the head and the heart of her who wrote it. I

            wish my Southern sisters could read it; they would then understand
            that the women of the North have engaged in this work from a sense
            of <em>religious duty</em>, and that nothing will ever induce them
            to take their hands from it until it is fully accomplished. They feel no
            hostility to you, no bitterness or wrath; they rather sympathize in your
            trials and difficulties; but they well know that the first thing to be done to
            help you, is to pour in the light of truth on your minds, to urge you
            to reflect on, and pray over the subject. This is all <em>they</em> can
            do for you, <em>you</em> must work out your own deliverance with fear
            and trembling, and with the direction and blessing of God,
            <em>you can do it</em>. Northern
            women may labor to produce a correct public opinion at the North,
            but if Southern women sit down in listless indifference and criminal
            idleness, public opinion cannot be rectified and purified at the South.
            It is manifest to every reflecting mind, that slavery must be abolished;
            the era in which we live, and the light which is overspreading
            the whole world on this subject, clearly show that the time cannot be
            distant when it will be done. Now there are only two ways in which
            it can be effected, by moral power or physical force, and it is for
            <em>you</em> to choose which of these you prefer. Slavery always
            has, and always will produce insurrections wherever it exists, because
            it is a violation of the natural order of things, and no human power
            can much longer perpetuate it. The opposers of abolitionists fully
            believe this; one of them remarked to me not long since, there is no
            doubt there will be a most terrible overturning at the South in a
            few years, such cruelty and wrong, must be visited with Divine
            vengeance soon. Abolitionists believe, too, that this must inevitably
            be the case, if you do not
            repent, and they are not willing to leave you to perish without entreating
            you, to save yourselves from destruction; well may they say
            with the apostle, "am I then your enemy because I tell you the truth,"
            and warn you to flee from impending judgments.

            But why, my dear friends, have I thus been endeavoring to lead you
            through the history of more than three thousand years, and to point
            you to that great cloud of witnesses who have gone before, "from
            works to rewards?" Have I been seeking to magnify the sufferings,
            and exalt the character of woman, that she "might have praise of
            men?" No! no! my object has been to arouse <em>you</em>, as the wives
            and mothers, the daughters and sisters, of the South, to a sense of
            your duty as <em>women</em>, and as Christian women, on that great
            subject, which has already shaken our country, from the St. Lawrence and
            the lakes, to the Gulf of Mexico, and from the Mississippi to the
            shores of the Atlantic; <em>and will continue mightily to shake it</em>,
            until the polluted temple of slavery fall and crumble into ruin. I would say
            unto each one of you, "what meanest thou, O sleeper! arise and call
            upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us that we perish
            not." Perceive you not that dark cloud of vengeance which hangs
            over our boasting Republic? Saw you not the lightnings of Heaven's
            wrath, in the flame which leaped from the Indian's torch to the
            roof of yonder dwelling, and lighted with its horrid glare the darkness
            of midnight? Heard you not the thunders of Divine anger, as the distant

            roar of the cannon came rolling onward, from the Texian country,
            where Protestant American Rebels are fighting with Mexican
            Republicans&#8212;for what? For the re-establishment of <em>slavery</em>; yes!
            of American slavery in the bosom of a Catholic Republic, where that
            system of robbery, violence, and wrong, had been legally abolished
            for twelve years. Yes! citizens of the United States, after plundering
            Mexico of her land, are now engaged in deadly conflict, for the
            privilege of fastening chains, and collars, and manacles&#8212;upon whom?
            upon the subjects of some foreign prince? No! upon native born
            American Republican citizens, although the fathers of these very men
            declared to the whole world, while struggling to free themselves from
            the three penny taxes of an English king, that they believed it to be
            a <em>self-evident</em> truth that <em>all men</em> were created
            equal, and had an <em>unalienable right to liberty</em>.

            Can you not, my friends, understand the signs of the times; do you
            not see the sword of retributive justice hanging over the South, or
            are you still slumbering at your posts?&#8212;Are there no Shiphrahs, no
            Puahs among you, who will dare in Christian firmness and Christian
            meekness, to refuse to obey the <em>wicked laws</em> which require
            <em>woman to enslave, to degrade and to brutalize woman?</em> Are
            there no Miriams, who would rejoice to lead out the captive daughters of
            the Southern States to liberty and light? Are there no Huldahs there
            who will dare to <em>speak the truth</em> concerning the sins of the
            people and those judgments, which it requires no prophet's eye to see,
            must follow if repentance is not speedily sought? Is there no Esther
            among you who will plead for the poor devoted slave? Read the history of this
            Persian queen, it is full of instruction; she at first refused to plead
            for the Jews; but, hear the words of Mordecai, "Think not within
            thyself, that <em>thou</em> shalt escape in the king's house more
            than all the Jews, for <em>if thou altogether holdest thy peace at
               this time</em>, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to
            the Jews from another place: but <em>thou and thy father's house
               shall be destroyed.</em>" Listen, too, to her magnanimous reply to
            this powerful appeal; "<em>I will go</em> in unto
            the king, which is not according to law, and if I perish. I perish."
            Yes! if there were but <em>one</em> Esther at the South, she
            <em>might</em> save her country from ruin; but let the Christian
            women there arise, as the Christian women of Great Britain did, in
            the majesty of moral power, and that salvation is certain. Let them
            embody themselves in societies,
            and send petitions up to their different legislatures, entreating
            their husbands, fathers, brothers and sons, to abolish the institution
            of slavery; no longer to subject <em>woman</em> to
            the scourge and the chain,
            to mental darkness and moral degradation; no longer to tear husbands
            from their wives, and children from their parents; no longer to make
            men, women, and children, work <em>without wages;</em> no longer to make
            their lives bitter in hard bondage; no longer to reduce <em>American
               citizens</em>
            to the abject condition of <em>slaves</em>, of "chattels personal;"
            no longer to barter the <em>image of God</em> in human shambles for
            corruptible things such as silver and gold.

            The <em>women of the South can overthrow</em> this horrible system
            of oppression and cruelty, licentiousness and wrong. Such appeals to
            your legislatures would be irresistible, for there is something in the
            heart of man which <em>will bend under moral suasion</em>. There is
            a swift witness for truth in his bosom, which <em>will respond to
               truth</em> when it is uttered with calmness and dignity. If you could
            obtain but six signatures to such a petition in only one state, I would
            say, send up that petition, and be not in the least discouraged by the
            scoffs and jeers of the heartless, or the resolution of the house
            to lay it on the table. It will be a great thing if the subject can
            be introduced into your
            legislatures in any way, even by <em>women</em>, and
            <em>they</em> will be the most
            likely to introduce it there in the best possible manner, as a matter
            of <em>morals</em> and <em>religion</em>, not of expediency or
            politics. You may
            petition, too, the different, ecclesiastical bodies of the slave states.
            Slavery must be attacked with the whole power of truth and the
            sword of the spirit. You must take it up on <em>Christian</em> ground,
            and fight against it with Christian weapons, whilst your feet are shod with
            the preparation of the gospel of peace. And <em>you are now</em> loudly
            called upon by the cries of the widow and the orphan, to arise and
            gird yourselves for this great moral conflict, with the whole armour
            of righteousness upon the right hand and on the left.

         </p>
         <p>
            There is every encouragement for you to labor and pray, my
            friends, because the abolition of slavery as well as its existence, has
            been the theme of prophecy. "Ethiopia (says the Psalmist) shall
            stretch forth her hands unto God." And is she not now doing so?
            Are not the Christian negroes of the south lifting their hands in prayer
            for deliverance, just as the Israelites did when their redemption was
            drawing nigh? Are they not sighing and crying by reason of the
            hard bondage? And think you, that He, of whom it was said, "and
            God heard their groaning, and their cry came up unto him by reason
            of the hard bondage," think you that his ear is heavy that he cannot
            <em>now</em> hear the cries of his suffering children? Or that He
            who raised up a Moses, an Aaron, and a Miriam, to bring them up out of the
            land of Egypt from the house of bondage, cannot now, with a high
            hand and a stretched out arm, rid the poor negroes out of the hands
            of their masters? Surely you believe that his arm is <em>not</em>
            shortened that he cannot save. And would not such a work of mercy redound
            to his glory? But another string of the harp of prophecy vibrates to
            the song of deliverance: "But they shall sit every man under his
            vine, and under his fig-tree, and <em>none shall make them afraid</em>;
            for the mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken it." The <em>slave</em>
            never can do this as long as he is a <em>slave</em>; whilst he is a
            "chattel personal" he can own <em>no</em> property; but the time
            <em>is to come</em> when <em>every</em> man is to
            sit under <em>his own</em> vine and <em>his own</em>
            fig-tree, and no domineering driver,
            or irresponsible master, or irascible mistress, shall make him afraid
            of the chain or the whip. Hear, too, the sweet tones of another

            string: "Many shall run to and fro, and <em>knowledge</em> shall
            be increased." Slavery is an insurmountable barrier to the
            increase of knowledge in every community where it exists;
            <em>slavery, then, must be
               abolished before</em> this prediction can be fulfiled.
            The last chord I shall touch, will be this, "They shall
            <em>not</em> hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain."

         </p>
         <p><em>Slavery, then, must be overthrown before</em> the prophecies
            can be accomplished,
            but how are they to be fulfiled? Will the wheels of the
            millennial car be rolled onward by miraculous power? No! God
            designs to confer this holy privilege upon <em>man</em>;
            it is through <em>his</em>
            instrumentality that the great and glorious work of reforming
            the world
            is to be done. And see you not how the mighty engine of <em>moral
               power</em>
            is dragging in its rear the Bible and peace societies, anti-slavery
            and temperance, sabbath schools, moral reform, and missions?
            or to adopt another figure, do not these seven philanthropic
            associations compose the beautiful tints in that bow of promise
            which spans
            the arch of our moral heaven? Who does not believe, that if these
            societies were broken up, their constitutions burnt, and the vast
            machinery with which they are laboring to regenerate mankind was
            stopped, that the black clouds of vengeance would soon burst over
            our world, and every city would witness the fate of the devoted cities
            of the plain? Each one of these societies is walking abroad through
            the earth scattering the seeds of truth over the wide field of our
            world, not with the hundred hands of a Briareus, but with a hundred
            thousand.

         </p>
         <p>
            Another encouragement for you to labor, my friends, is, that you
            will have the prayers and co-operation of English and Northern
            philanthropists. You will never bend your knees in supplication
            at the throne of grace for the overthrow of slavery, without
            meeting there the spirits of other Christians, who will mingle
            their voices with yours,
            as the morning or evening sacrifice ascends to God. Yes, the spirit
            of prayer and of supplication has been poured out upon many, many
            hearts; there are wrestling Jacobs who will not let go of the
            prophetic promises of deliverance for the captive, and the
            opening of prison doors
            to them that are bound. There are Pauls who are saying, in reference
            to this subject, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" There are
            Marys sitting in the house now, who are ready to arise and go forth
            is this work as soon as the message is brought, "the master is come
            and calleth for thee." And there are Marthas, too, who have already
            gone out to meet Jesus, as he bends his footsteps to their brother's
            grave, and weeps, <em>not</em> over the lifeless body of
            Lazarus bound hand
            and foot in grave-clothes, but over the politically and intellectually
            lifeless slave, bound hand and foot in the iron chains of
            oppression and ignorance. Some may be ready to say, as Martha did,
            who seemed to expect nothing but sympathy from Jesus, "Lord, by
            this time he
            stinketh, for he hath been dead four days." She thought it useless
            to remove the stone and expose the loathsome body of her brother;
            she could not believe that so great a miracle could be wrought, as to
            raise <em>that putrefied body</em> into life; but "Jesus said,
            take <em>ye</em> away the

            stone;" and when <em>they</em> had taken away the stone
            where the dead was
            laid, and uncovered the body of Lazarus, then it was that "Jesus
            lifted up his eyes and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard
            me," &amp;c. "And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
            Lazarus, come forth." Yes, some may be ready to say of the
            colored race, how can <em>they</em> ever be raised politically
            and intellectually,
            they have been dead four hundred years? But <em>we</em>
            have <em>nothing</em>
            to do with <em>how</em> this is to be done;
            <em>our business</em> is to take away the
            stone which has covered up the dead body of our brother, to expose
            the putrid carcass, to show <em>how</em> that body has been
            bound with the
            grave-clothes of heathen ignorance, and his face with the napkin of
            prejudice, and having done all it was our duty to do, to stand by
            the negro's grave, in humble faith and holy hope, waiting to hear
            the life-giving command of "Lazarus, come forth." This is just
            what Anti-Slavery Societies are doing; they are taking away the
            stone from the mouth of the tomb of slavery, where lies the putrid
            carcass of our brother. They want the pure light of heaven to shine
            into that dark and gloomy cave; they want all men to
            see <em>how</em> that
            dead body has been bound, <em>how</em> that face has
            been wrapped in the
            <em>napkin of prejudice</em>; and shall they wait beside that
            grave in vain?
            Is not Jesus still the resurrection and the life? Did He come
            to proclaim
            liberty to the captive, and the opening of prison doors to them
            that are bound, in vain? Did He promise to give beauty for ashes,
            the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit
            of heaviness unto them that mourn in Zion, and will He refuse to
            beautify the mind, anoint the head, and throw around the captive
            negro the mantle of praise for that spirit of heaviness which has so
            long bound him down to the ground? Or shall we not rather say
            with the prophet, "the zeal of the Lord of Hosts <em>will</em>
            perform this?"
            Yes, his promises are sure, and amen in Christ Jesus, that he will
            assemble her that halteth, and gather her that is driven out, and her
            that is afflicted.

         <p>
            But I will now say a few words on the subject of Abolitionism.
            Doubtless you have all heard Anti-Slavery Societies denounced as
            insurrectionary and mischievous, fanatical and dangerous. It has
            been said they publish the most abominable untruths, and that they
            are endeavoring to excite rebellions at the South. Have you believed
            these reports, my friends? have <em>you</em> also been deceived
            by these false
            assertions? Listen to me, then, whilst I endeavor to wipe from the
            fair character of Abolitionism such unfounded accusations. You
            know that <em>I</em> am a Southerner; you know that my dearest
            relatives
            are now in a slave State. Can you for a moment believe I would
            prove so recreant to the feelings of a daughter and a sister, as
            to join a society which was seeking to overthrow slavery by
            falsehood, bloodshed,
            and murder? I appeal to you who have known and loved me
            in days that are passed, can <em>you</em> believe it? No! my
            friends. As a
            Carolinian, I was peculiarly jealous of any movements on this
            subject;
            and before I would join an Anti-Slavery Society, I took the
            precaution
            of becoming acquainted with some of the leading Abolitionists,

            of reading their publications and attending their meetings, at which I
            heard addresses both from colored and white men; and it was not
            until I was fully convinced that their principles were
            <em>entirely pacific</em>, and their efforts
            <em>only moral</em>, that I gave my name as a member to the
            Female Anti-Slavery Society of Philadelphia. Since that time, I
            have regularly taken the Liberator, and read many Anti-Slavery
            pamphlets and papers and books, and can assure you
            I <em>never</em> have
            seen a single insurrectionary paragraph, and never read any account
            of cruelty which I could not believe. Southerners may deny the
            truth of these accounts, but why do they not <em>prove</em> them
            to be false.
            Their violent expressions of horror at such accounts being believed,
            <em>may</em> deceive some, but they cannot deceive
            <em>me</em>, for I lived too long
            in the midst of slavery, not to know what slavery is.
            When <em>I</em> speak
            of this system, "I speak that I do know," and I am not at all afraid
            to assert, that Anti-Slavery publications have <em>not</em>
            overdrawn the monstrous features of slavery at all. And many a
            Southerner <em>knows</em> this
            as well as I do. A lady in North Carolina remarked to a friend of
            mine, about eighteen months since, "Northerners know nothing at all
            about slavery; they think it is perpetual bondage only; but of the
            <em>depth of degradation</em> that word involves, they have
            no conception; if they had, <em>they would never cease</em>
            their efforts until so <em>horrible</em> a system
            was overthrown." She did not know how faithfully some Northern
            men and Northern women had studied this subject; how diligently
            they had searched out the cause of "him who had none to help him,"
            and how fearlessly they had told the story of the negro's wrongs.
            Yes, Northerners know <em>every</em> thing about slavery now.
            This monster of iniquity has been unveiled to the world, her
            frightful features unmasked,
            and soon, very soon will she be regarded with no more
            complacency by the American republic than is the idol of Juggernaut,
            rolling its bloody wheels over the crushed bodies of its prostrate
            Victims.

         </p>
         <p>
            But you will probably ask, if Anti-Slavery societies are not
            insurrectionary,
            why do Northerners tell us they are? Why, I would ask
            you in return, did Northern senators and Northern representatives
            give their votes, at the last sitting of congress, to the admission of
            Arkansas Territory as a state? Take those men, one by one, and
            ask them in their parlours, do you <em>approve of slavery?</em>
            ask them on
            <em>Northern</em> ground, where they will speak the truth,
            and I doubt not <em>every man</em> of them will tell you,
            <em>no!</em> Why then, I ask, did <em>they</em> give
            their votes to enlarge the mouth of that grave which has already
            destroyed its tens of thousands? All our enemies tell
            <em>us</em> they are as
            much anti-slavery as we are. Yes, my friends, thousands who are
            helping you to bind the fetters of slavery on the negro, despise
            you in their hearts for doing it; they rejoice that such an
            institution has not been entailed upon them. Why then, I would
            ask, do <em>they</em> lend you
            their help? I will tell you, "they love
            <em>the praise of men more</em> than
            the praise of God." The Abolition cause has not yet become so
            popular as to induce them to believe, that by advocating it
            in congress,
            they shall sit still more securely in their seats there, and like

            the <em>chief rulers</em> in the days of our Saviour, though
            many believed on him, yet they did <em>not</em> confess him,
            lest they should <em>be put out of the
               synagogue</em>; John xii, 42, 43. Or perhaps like Pilate, thinking
            they could prevail nothing, and fearing a tumult, they determined
            to release
            Barabbas and surrender the just man, the poor innocent slave to be
            stripped of his rights and scourged. In vain will such men try to
            wash their hands, and say, with the Roman governor, "I am innocent
            of the blood of this just person." Northern American statesmen
            are no more innocent of the crime of slavery, than Pilate was of the
            murder of Jesus, or Saul of that of Stephen. These are high charges,
            but I appeal to <em>their hearts</em>; I appeal to public
            opinion ten years
            from now. Slavery then is a national sin.

         </p>
         <p>
            But you will say, a great many other Northerners tell us so, who
            can have no political motives. The interests of the North, you must
            know, my friends, are very closely combined with those of the South.
            The Northern merchants and manufacturers are making
            <em>their</em> fortunes out of the
            <em>produce of slave labor</em>; the grocer is selling
            your rice and sugar; how then can these men bear a testimony
            against slavery
            without condemning themselves? But there is another reason, the
            North is most dreadfully afraid of Amalgamation. She is alarmed
            at the very idea of a thing so monstrous, as she thinks. And lest
            this consequence <em>might</em> flow from emancipation,
            she is determined to resist all efforts at emancipation without
            expatriation. It is not because
            <em>she approves of slavery</em>, or believes it to be
            "the corner stone of our republic," for she is as
            much <em>anti-slavery</em> as we are; but amalgamation is
            too horrible to think of. Now I would ask <em>you</em>, is
            it right, is it generous, to refuse the colored people
            in this country the advantages of education and the privilege,
            or rather the <em>right</em>, to follow
            honest trades and callings merely because they are colored?
            The same prejudice exists here against our colored brethren that
            existed against the Gentiles in Judea. Great numbers cannot bear
            the idea of equality, and fearing lest, if they had the same
            advantages we enjoy, they would become as intelligent, as moral,
            as religious,
            and as respectable and wealthy, they are determined to keep them as
            low as they possibly can. Is this doing as they would be done by?
            Is this loving their neighbor <em>as themselves</em>?
            Oh! that <em>such</em> opposers
            of Abolitionism would put their souls in the stead of the free colored
            man's and obey the apostolic injunction, to "remember them that are
            in bonds <em>as bound with them</em>." I will leave you to
            judge whether the
            fear of amalgamation ought to induce men to oppose anti-slavery
            efforts, when <em>they</em> believe <em>slavery</em>
            to be <em>sinful</em>. Prejudice against
            color, is the most powerful enemy we have to fight with at the North.

         </p>
         <p>
            You need not be surprised, then, at all, at what is said <em>against</em>
            Abolitionists by the North, for they are wielding a two-edged sword,
            which even here, cuts through the <em>cords of caste</em>, on the one side,
            and the <em>bonds of interest</em> on the other. They are only sharing the
            fate of other reformers, abused and reviled whilst they are in the minority;
            but they are neither angry nor discouraged by the invective
            which has been heaped upon them by slaveholders at the South and

            their apologists at the North. They know that when George Fox
            and William Edmundson were laboring in behalf of the negroes in
            the West Indies in 1671 that the very <em>same</em> slanders were propogated
            against them, which are <em>now</em> circulated against Abolitionists. Although
            it was well known that Fox was the founder of a religious
            sect which repudiated <em>all</em> war, and <em>all</em> violence,
            yet <em>even he</em> was accused
            of "endeavoring to excite the slaves to insurrection and of
            teaching the negroes to cut their master's throats." And these two
            men who had their feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of
            Peace, were actually compelled to draw up a formal declaration that
            <em>they were not</em> trying to raise a rebellion in Barbadoes. It is also
            worthy of remark that these Reformers did not at this time see the
            necessity of emancipation under seven years, and their principal
            efforts were exerted to persuade the planters of the necessity of instructing
            their slaves; but the slaveholder saw then, just what the
            slaveholder sees now, that an <em>enlightened</em> population
            <em>never</em> can be a
            <em>slave</em> population, and therefore they passed a law, that negroes should
            not even attend the meetings of Friends. Abolitionists know that the
            life of Clarkson was sought by slavetraders; and that even Wilberforce
            was denounced on the floor of Parliament as a fanatic and a
            hypocrite by the present King of England, the very man who, in 1834,
            set his seal to that instrument which burst the fetters of eight hundred
            thousand slaves in his West India colonies. They know that the
            first Quaker who bore a <em>faithful</em> testimony against the sin of slavery
            was cut off from religious fellowship with that society. That Quaker
            was a <em>woman</em>. On her deathbed she sent for the committee who dealt
            with her&#8212;she told them, the near approach of death had not altered
            her sentiments on the subject of slavery and waving her hand towards
            a very fertile and beautiful portion of country which lay stretched before
            her window, she said with great solemnity, "Friends, the time
            will come when there will not be friends enough in all this district to
            hold one meeting for worship, and this garden will be turned into a
            wilderness."

         </p>
         <p>
            The aged friend, who with tears in his eyes, related this interesting
            circumstance to me, remarked, that at that time there were seven
            meetings of friends in that part of Virginia, but that when he was
            there ten years ago, not a single meeting was held, and the country
            was literally a desolation. Soon after her decease, John Woolman
            began his labors in our society, and instead of disowning a member
            for testifying <em>against</em> slavery, they have for fifty-two
            years positively forbidden their members to hold slaves.

         </p>
         <p>
            Abolitionists understand the slaveholding spirit too well to be surprised
            at any thing that has yet happened at the South or the North;
            they know that the greater the sin is, which is exposed, the more violent
            will be the efforts to blacken the character and impugn the motives
            of those who are engaged in bringing to light the hidden things
            of darkness. They understand the work of Reform too well to be
            driven back by the furious waves of opposition, which are only foaming
            out their own shame. They have stood "the world's dread

            laugh," when only twelve men formed the first Anti-Slavery Society
            in Boston in 1831. They have faced and refuted the calumnies of
            their enemies, and proved themselves to be emphatically <em>peace men</em> by
            <em>never resisting</em> the violence of mobs, even when driven by them from
            the temple of God, and dragged by an infuriated crowd through the
            streets of the emporium of New-England, or subjected by <em>slaveholders</em>
            to the pain of corporal punishment. "None of these things move
            them;" and, by the grace of God, they are determined to persevere
            in this work of faith and labor of love: they mean to pray, and
            preach, and write, and print, until slavery is completely overthrown,
            until Babylon is taken up and cast into the sea, to "be found no
            more at all." They mean to petition Congress year after year, until
            the seat of our government is cleansed from the sinful traffic of
            "slaves and the souls of men." Although that august assembly may
            be like the unjust judge who "feared not God neither regarded man,"
            yet it must yield just as he did, from the power of importunity. Like
            the unjust judge, Congress <em>must</em> redress the wrongs of the widow,
            lest by the continual coming up of petitions, it be wearied. This will
            be striking the dagger into the very heart of the monster, and once
            'tis done, he must soon expire.

         </p>
         <p>
            Abolitionists have been accused of abusing their Southern brethren.
            Did the prophet Isaiah <em>abuse</em> the Jews when he addressed to them
            the cutting reproofs contained in the first chapter of his prophecies,
            and ended by telling them, they would be <em>ashamed</em> of the oaks they
            had desired, and <em>confounded</em> for the garden they had chosen? Did
            John the Baptist <em>abuse</em> the Jews when he called them "<em>a generation
               of vipers</em>," and warned them "to bring forth fruits meet for repentance?"
            Did Peter abuse the Jews when he told them they were the
            <em>murderers</em> of the Lord of Glory? Did Paul abuse the Roman Governor
            when he reasoned before him of righteousness, temperance,
            and judgment, so as to send conviction home to his guilty heart, and
            cause him to tremble in view of the crimes he was living in? Surely
            not. No man will now accuse the prophets and apostles of <em>abuse</em>,
            but what have Abolitionists done more than they? No doubt the
            Jews thought the prophets and apostles in their day, just as harsh
            and uncharitable as slaveholders now, think Abolitionists; if they
            did not, why did they beat, and stone, and kill them?

         </p>
         <p>
            Great fault has been found with the prints which have been employed
            to expose slavery at the North, but my friends, how could this
            be done so effectually in any other way? Until the pictures of the
            slave's sufferings were drawn and held up to public gaze, no Northerner
            had any idea of the cruelty of the system, it never entered their
            minds that such abominations could exist in Christian, Republican
            America; they never suspected that many of the <em>gentlemen</em>
            and <em>ladies</em>
            who came from the South to spend the summer months in travelling
            among them, were petty tyrants at home. And those who had lived
            at the South, and came to reside at the North, were too <em>ashamed of
               slavery</em> even to speak of it; the language of their hearts was, "tell it
            <em>not</em> in Gath, publish it <em>not</em> in the streets of
            Askelon;" they saw no

            use in uncovering the loathsome body to popular sight, and
            in hopeless despair,
            wept in secret places over the sins of oppression. To
            such hidden mourners the formation of Anti-Slavery Societies was
            as life from the dead, the first beams of hope which gleamed through
            the dark clouds of despondency and grief. Prints were made use
            of to effect the abolition of the Inquisition in Spain, and Clarkson
            employed them when he was laboring to break up the Slave trade,
            and English Abolitionists used them just as we are now doing.
            They are powerful appeals and have invariably done the work they
            were designed to do, and we cannot consent to abandon the use of
            these until the <em>realities</em> no longer exist.

            With regard to those white men, who, it was said, did try to raise
            an insurrection in Mississippi a year ago, and who were stated to be
            Abolitionists, none of them were proved to be members of
            Anti-Slavery Societies, and it must remain a matter of
            great doubt whether,
            even they were guilty of the crimes alledged against them, because
            when any community is thrown into such a panic as to inflict Lynch
            law upon accused persons, they cannot be supposed to be capable of
            judging with calmness and impartiality. <em>We know</em> that the
            papers of which the Charleston mail was robbed, were <em>not</em>
            insurrectionary, and that they were <em>not</em> sent to the
            colored people as was reported. <em>We know</em> that Amos Dresser
            was <em>no insurrectionist</em> though he was accused
            of being so, and on this false accusation was publicly whipped in
            Nashville in the midst of a crowd of infuriated <em>slaveholders</em>.
            Was that young man disgraced by this infliction of corporal punishment?
            No more than was the great apostle of the Gentiles who five times
            received forty stripes, save one. Like him, he might have said,
            "henceforth I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus," for
            it was for the <em>truth's sake, he suffered</em>, as much as
            did the Apostle Paul. Are Nelson, and Garrett, and Williams, and
            other Abolitionists who have recently been banished from Missouri,
            insurrectionists?
            <em>We know</em> they are <em>not</em>, whatever slaveholders
            may choose to call them.
            The spirit which now asperses the character of the Abolitionists, is the
            <em>very same</em> which dressed up the Christians of Spain in
            the skins of wild beasts and pictures of devils when they were led
            to execution as heretics. Before we condemn individuals, it is
            necessary, even in a wicked
            community, to accuse them of some crime; hence, when Jezebel
            wished to compass the death of Naboth, men of Belial were suborned
            to bear <em>false</em> witness against him, and so it was with
            Stephen, and so it ever has been, and ever will be, as long as there
            is any virtue to suffer on the rack, or the gallows. <em>False</em>
            witnesses must appear
            against Abolitionists before they can be condemned.

         </p>
         <p>
            I will now say a few words on George Thompson's mission to
            this country. This Philanthropist was accused of being a foreign
            emissary. Were La Fayette, and Steuben, and De Kalb, foreign
            emissaries when they came over to America to fight against the
            tories, who preferred submitting to what was termed, "the yoke of
            servitude," rather than bursting the fetters which bound them to the
            mother country? <em>They</em> came with <em>carnal weapons</em> to
            engage in <em>bloody</em>
            conflict against American citizens, and yet, where do their names
            stand on the page of History. Among the honorable, or the low?
            Thompson came here to war against the giant sin of slavery,
            <em>not</em> with
            the sword and the pistol, but with the smooth stones of oratory taken
            from the pure waters of the river of Truth. His splendid talents
            and commanding eloquence rendered him a powerful coadjutor in the
            Anti-Slavery cause, and in order to neutralize the effects of these
            upon his auditors, and rob the poor slave of the benefits of his labors,
            his character was defamed, his life was sought, and he at last driven
            from our Republic, as a fugitive. But was <em>Thompson</em> disgraced
            by all this mean and contemptible and wicked chicanery and malice? No
            more than was Paul, when in consequence of a vision he had seen at
            Troas, he went over to Macedonia to help the Christians there, and
            was beaten and imprisoned, because he cast out a spirit of divination
            from a young damsel which had brought much gain to her masters.
            Paul was as much a <em>foreign emissary</em> in the Roman colony
            of Philippi, as George Thompson was in America, and it was because
            he was a <em>Jew</em>, and taught customs it was not lawful for
            them to receive or observe, being Romans, that the Apostle was thus
            treated.

         </p>
         <p>
            It was said, Thompson was a felon, who had fled to this country to
            escape transportation to New Holland. Look at him now pouring
            the thundering strains of his eloquence, upon crowded audiences in
            Great Britain, and see in this a triumphant vindication of his character.
            And have the slaveholder, and his obsequious apologist, gained
            any thing by all their violence and falsehood? No! for the stone
            which struck Goliath of Gath, had already been thrown from the
            sling. The giant of slavery who had so proudly defied the armies
            of the living God, had received his death-blow before he left our
            shores. But what is George Thompson doing there? Is he not now
            laboring there, as effectually to abolish American slavery as though
            he trod our own soil, and lectured to New York or Boston assemblies?
            What is he doing there, but constructing a stupendous dam,
            which will turn the overwhelming tide of public opinion over the
            wheels of that machinery which Abolitionists are working here. He
            is now lecturing to <em>Britons</em> on <em>American Slavery</em>,
            to the <em>subjects</em> of a <em>King</em>, on the abject
            condition of the <em>slaves of a Republic</em>. He is telling
            them of that mighty confederacy of petty tyrants which extends
            ever thirteen States of our Union. He is telling them of the munificent
            rewards offered by slaveholders, for the heads of the most distinguished
            advocates for freedom in this country. He is moving the
            British Churches to send out to the churches of America the most
            solemn appeals, reproving, rebuking, and exhorting them with all
            long suffering and patience to abandon the sin of slavery immediately.
            Where then I ask, will the name of George Thompson stand on the
            page of History? Among the honorable, or the base?

         </p>
         <p>
            What can I say more, my friends, to induce <em>you</em> to set
            your hands, and heads, and hearts, to this great work of justice
            and mercy. Perhaps you have feared the consequences of immediate
            Emancipation,
            and been frightened by all those dreadful prophecies of rebellion,

            bloodshed and murder, which have been uttered. "Let no man deceive
            you;" they are the predictions of that same "lying spirit" which
            spoke through the four thousand prophets of old, to Ahab king of
            Israel, urging him on to destruction. <em>Slavery</em> may produce these
            horrible scenes if it is continued five years longer, but Emancipation
            <em>never will</em>.

         </p>
         <p>
            I can prove the <em>safety</em> of immediate Emancipation by history. In
            St. Domingo in 1793 six hundred thousand slaves were set free in a
            white population of forty-two thousand. That Island "marched as
            by enchantment towards its ancient splendor", cultivation prospered,
            every day produced perceptible proofs of its progress, and the
            negroes all continued quietly to work on the different plantations,
            until in 1802, France determined to reduce these liberated slaves
            again to bondage. It was at <em>this time</em> that all those
            dreadful scenes of cruelty occurred, which we so often
            <em>unjustly</em> hear spoken of, as the
            effects of Abolition. They were occasioned <em>not</em> by
            Emancipation, but by the base attempt to fasten the chains of
            slavery on the limbs of liberated slaves.

         </p>
         <p>
            In Guadaloupe eighty-five thousand slaves were freed in a white
            population of thirteen thousand. The same prosperous effects followed
            manumission here, that had attended it in Hayti, every thing
            was quiet until Buonaparte sent out a fleet to reduce these negroes
            again to slavery, and in 1802 this institution was re-established in
            that Island. In 1834, when Great Britain determined to liberate the
            slaves in her West India colonies, and proposed the apprenticeship
            system; the planters of Bermuda and Antigua, after having joined
            the other planters in their representations of the bloody consequences
            of Emancipation, in order if possible to hold back the hand which
            was offering the boon of freedom to the poor negro; as soon as they
            found such falsehoods were utterly disregarded, and Abolition must
            take place, came forward voluntarily, and asked for the compensation
            which was due to them, saying, <em>they preferred immediate
               emancipation</em>,
            and were not afraid of any insurrection. And how is it with these
            islands now? They are decidedly more prosperous than any of those
            in which the apprenticeship system was adopted, and England is now
            trying to abolish that system, so fully convinced is she that immediate
            Emancipation is the <em>safest</em> and the best plan.

         </p>
         <p>
            And why not try it in the Southern States, if it <em>never</em> has
            occasioned rebellion; if <em>not a drop of blood</em> has ever
            been shed in consequence of it, though it has been so often tried,
            why should we suppose it would produce such disastrous consequences
            now? "Be not deceived then, God is not mocked," by such false excuses
            for not doing justly and loving mercy. There is nothing to fear from
            immediate Emancipation, but <em>every thing</em> from the continuance
            of slavery.

         </p>
         <p>
            Sisters in Christ, I have done. As a Southerner, I have felt it was
            my duty to address you. I have endeavoured to set before you the
            exceeding sinfulness of slavery, and to point you to the example of
            those noble women who have been raised up in the church to effect
            great revolutions, and to suffer for the truth's sake. I have appealed

            to your sympathies as women, to your sense of duty as <em>Christian
               women</em>&gt;. I have attempted to vindicate the Abolitionists, to prove the
            entire safety of immediate Emancipation, and to plead the cause of
            the poor and oppressed. I have done&#8212;I have sowed the seeds of
            truth, but I well know, that even if an Apollos were to follow in
            my steps to water them, "<em>God only</em> can give the increase." To
            Him then who is able to prosper the work of his servant's hand, I
            commend this Appeal in fervent prayer, that as he "hath <em>chosen the
               weak things of the world</em>, to confound the things which are mighty,"
            so He may cause His blessing, to descend and carry conviction to the
            hearts of many Lydias through these speaking pages. Farewell.&#8212;Count
            me not your "enemy because I have told you the truth," but
            believe me in unfeigned affection,

         <p>RESPECTED FRIENDS,</p>
         <p>
            It is because I feel a deep and tender interest in your present and
            eternal welfare that I am willing thus publicly to address you. Some
            of you have loved me as a relative, and some have felt bound to me
            in Christian sympathy, and Gospel fellowship; and even when compelled
            by a strong sense of duty, to break those outward bonds of
            union which bound us together as members of the same community,
            and members of the same religious denomination, you were generous
            enough to give me credit, for sincerity as a Christian, though you
            believed I had been most strangely deceived. I thanked you then
            for your kindness, and I ask you <em>now</em>, for the sake of
            former confidence,
            and former friendship, to read the following pages in the spirit
            of calm investigation and fervent prayer. It is because you have
            known me, that I write thus unto you.

         </p>
         <p>
            But there are other Christian women scattered over the Southern
            States, of whom a very large number have never seen me, and
            never heard my name, and feel <em>no</em> personal interest
            whatever in <em>me</em>.
            But I feel an interest in <em>you</em>, as branches of the same
            vine from whose
            root I daily draw the principle of spiritual vitality&#8212;Yes! Sisters
            in Christ I feel an interest in <em>you</em>, and often has the
            secret prayer
            arisen on your behalf, Lord "open thou their eyes that they may see
            wondrous things out of thy Law"&#8212;It is then, because I
            <em>do feel</em> and <em>do pray</em> for you, that I thus
            address you upon a subject about which
            of all others, perhaps you would rather not hear any thing; but,
            "would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly, and indeed
            bear with me, for I am jealous over you with godly jealousy."
            Be not afraid then to read my appeal; it is <em>not</em>
            written in the heat of
            passion or prejudice, but in that solemn calmness which is the result
            of conviction and duty. It is true, I am going to tell you unwelcome
            truths, but I mean to speak these <em>truths in love</em>, and remember

            Solomon says, "faithful are the <em>wounds</em> of a friend."
            I do not believe the time has yet come when <em>Christian women</em>
            "will not endure sound doctrine," even on the subject of Slavery,
            if it is spoken to them in tenderness and love, therefore I now
            address <em>you</em>.

            To all of you then, known or unknown, relatives or strangers, (for
            you are all <em>one</em> in Christ,) I would speak. I have felt
            for you at this
            time, when unwelcome light is pouring in upon the world on the
            subject of slavery; light which even Christians would exclude, if
            they could, from our country, or at any rate from the southern portion
            of it, saying, as its rays strike the rock bound coasts of New
            England and scatter their warmth and radiance over her hills and
            valleys, and from thence travel onward over the Palisades of the
            Hudson, and down the soft flowing waters of the Delaware and
            gild the waves of the Potomac, "hitherto shalt thou come and no
            further;" I know that even professors of His name who has been
            emphatically called the "Light of the world" would, if they could,
            build a wall of adamant around the Southern States whose top might
            reach unto heaven, in order to shut out the light which is bounding
            from mountain to mountain and from the hills to the plains and valleys
            beneath, through the vast extent of our Northern States. But
            believe me, when I tell you, their attempts will be as utterly fruitless
            as were the efforts of the builders of Babel; and why? Because
            moral, like natural light, is so extremely subtle in its nature as to
            overleap all human barriers, and laugh at the puny efforts of man to
            control it. All the excuses and palliations of this system must inevitably
            be swept away, just as other "refuges of lies" have been, by
            the irresistible torrent of a rectified public opinion. "The
            <em>supporters</em> of the slave system," says Jonathan Dymond
            in his admirable work on the Principles of Morality, "will
            <em>hereafter</em> be regarded with the <em>same</em>
            public feeling, as he who was an advocate for the slave trade
            <em>now</em> is."
            It will be, and that very soon, clearly perceived and fully acknowledged
            by all the virtuous and the candid, that in <em>principle</em> it is as
            sinful to hold a human being in bondage who has been born in
            Carolina, as one who has been born in Africa. All that sophistry
            of argument which has been employed to prove, that although it is
            sinful to send to Africa to procure men and women as slaves, who
            have never been in slavery, that still, it is not sinful to keep those in
            bondage who have come down by inheritance, will be utterly overthrown.
            We must come back to the good old doctrine of our forefathers
            who declared to the world, "this self evident truth that <em>all</em>
            men are created equal, and that they have certain <em>inalienable</em>
            rights among which are life, <em>liberty</em>, and the pursuit of
            happiness." It is even a greater absurdity to suppose a man can be
            legally born a slave under <em>our free Republican</em> Government,
            than under the petty
            despotisms of barbarian Africa. If then, we have no right to enslave
            an African, surely we can have none to enslave an American; if it is
            a self evident truth that <em>all</em> men, every where and of
            every color are born equal, and have an
            <em>inalienable right to liberty</em>, then it is equally
            true that <em>no</em> man can be born a slave, and no man can
            ever <em>rightfully</em>
            be reduced to <em>involuntary</em> bondage and held as a slave,
            however fair
            may be the claim of his master or mistress through wills and title-deeds.

            But after all, it may be said, our fathers were certainly mistaken, for
            the Bible sanctions Slavery, and that is the highest authority. Now
            the Bible is my ultimate appeal in all matters of faith and practice,
            and it is to <em>this test</em> I am anxious to bring the subject
            at issue between
            us. Let us then begin with Adam and examine the charter
            of privileges which was given to him. "Have dominion over the fish
            of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing
            that moveth upon the earth." In the eighth Psalm we have a still
            fuller description of this charter which through Adam was given to all
            mankind. "Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of
            thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet. All sheep and
            oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field, the fowl of the air, the fish of
            the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas."
            And after the flood when this charter of human rights was renewed,
            we find <em>no additional</em> power vested in man. "And the fear of you
            and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and
            every fowl of the air, and upon all that moveth upon the earth, and
            upon all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered."
            In this charter, although the different kinds of <em>irrational</em>
            beings are so particularly enumerated, and supreme dominion
            over <em>all of them</em> is granted, yet <em>man</em> is
            <em>never</em> vested with this dominion <em>over his fellow
               man</em>; he was never told that any of the human species were put
            <em>under his feet</em>; it was only <em>all things</em>, and
            man, who was created in the image of his Maker, <em>never</em> can
            properly be termed a <em>thing</em>, though the laws of Slave States
            do call him "a chattel personal;" <em>Man</em> then,
            I assert <em>never</em> was put <em>under the feet of man</em>,
            by that first charter
            of human right, which was given by God, to the Fathers of the Antediluvian
            and Postdiluvian worlds, therefore this doctrine of equality
            is based on the Bible.

         </p>
         <p>
            But it may be argued, that in the very chapter of Genesis from
            which I have last quoted, will be found the curse pronounced upon
            Canaan, by which his posterity was consigned to servitude under his
            brothers Shem and Japheth. I know this prophecy was uttered, and
            was most fearfully and wonderfully fulfilled, through the immediate
            descendants of Canaan, i.e. the Canaanites, and I do not know but
            it has been through all the children of Ham, but I do know that
            prophecy does <em>not</em> tell us what <em>ought to be</em>, but
            what actually does
            take place, ages after it has been delivered, and that if we justify
            America for enslaving the children of Africa, we must also justify
            Egypt for reducing the children of Israel to bondage, for the latter
            was foretold as explicitly as the former. I am well aware that prophecy
            has often been urged as an excuse for Slavery, but be not
            deceived, the fulfilment of prophecy will <em>not cover one sin</em>
            in the awful
            day of account. Hear what our Saviour says on this subject; "it
            must needs be that offences come, but <em>woe unto that man through
               whom they come</em>"&#8212;Witness some fulfilment of this declaration
            in the
            tremendous destruction of Jerusalem, occasioned by that most nefarious

            of all crimes the crucifixion of the Son of God. Did the fact
            of that event having been foretold, exculpate the Jews from sin in
            perpetrating it; No&#8212;for hear what the Apostle Peter says to them
            on this subject, "Him being delivered by the determinate counsel
            and foreknowledge of God, <em>ye</em> have taken, and by
            <em>wicked</em> hands have
            crucified and slain." Other striking instances might be adduced, but
            these will suffice.

         </p>
         <p>
            But it has been urged that the patriarchs held slaves, and therefore,
            slavery is right. Do you really believe that patriarchal servitude was
            like American slavery? Can you believe it? If so, read the history of
            these primitive fathers of the church and be undeceived. Look at
            Abraham, though so great a man, going to the herd himself and
            fetching a calf from thence and serving it up with his own hands, for
            the entertainment of his guests. Look at Sarah, that princess as her
            name signifies, baking cakes upon the hearth. If the servants they
            had were like Southern slaves, would they have performed such
            comparatively menial offices for themselves? Hear too the plaintive
            lamentation of Abraham when he feared he should have no son to
            bear his name down to posterity. "Behold thou hast given me no
            seed, &amp;c., one born in my house is <em>mine</em> heir." From this
            it appears that one of his <em>servants</em> was to inherit his
            immense estate. Is this
            like Southern slavery? I leave it to your own good sense and candor
            to decide. Besides, such was the footing upon which Abraham was
            with <em>his</em> servants, that he trusted them with arms.
            Are slaveholders
            willing to put swords and pistols into the hands of their slaves? He
            was as a father among his servants; what are planters and masters
            generally among theirs? When the institution of circumcision was
            established, Abraham was commanded thus; "He that is eight days
            old shall be circumcised among you, <em>every</em> man-child in
            your generations;
            he that is born in the house, or bought with money of
            any stranger which is not of thy seed." And to render this command
            with regard to his <em>servants</em> still more impressive
            it is repeated
            in the very next verse; and herein we may perceive the great care
            which was taken by God to guard the <em>rights of servants</em>
            even under
            this "dark dispensation." What too was the testimony given to the
            faithfulness of this eminent patriarch. "For I know him that he will
            command his children and his <em>household</em> after him, and
            they shall
            keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment." Now my
            dear friends many of you believe that circumcision has been superseded
            by baptism in the Church; <em>Are you</em> careful to
            have <em>all</em> that
            are born in your house or bought with money of any stranger, baptized?
            Are <em>you</em> as faithful as Abraham to command
            <em>your household</em> to
            <em>keep the way of the Lord?</em> I leave it to your own
            consciences to decide.
            Was patriarchal servitude then like American Slavery?

         </p>
         <p>
            But I shall be told, God sanctioned Slavery, yea commanded Slavery
            under the Jewish Dispensation. Let us examine this subject
            calmly and prayerfully. I admit that a species of
            <em>servitude</em> was permitted
            to the Jews, but in studying the subject I have been struck
            with wonder and admiration at perceiving how carefully the servant

            was guarded from violence, injustice, and wrong. I will first inform
            you how these servants became servants, for I think this a very important
            part of our subject. From consulting Horne, Calmet, and
            the Bible, I find there were six different ways by which the Hebrews
            became servants legally.

         </p>
         <p>
            1. A Hebrew, whose father was still alive, and who on that account
            had not inherited his patrimonial estate, might sell himself, i.e., his
            services, for six years, in which case <em>he</em> received the
            purchase money <em>himself</em>. Ex. xxi, 2.

         </p>
         <p>
            2. A father might sell his children as servants, i.e., his
            <em>daughters</em>, in which circumstance it was understood
            the daughter was to be the wife or daughter-in-law of the man who
            bought her, and the <em>father</em> received the price. In other
            words, Jewish women were sold as <em>white women</em> were in the
            first settlement of Virginia&#8212;as <em>wives, not</em> as slaves.
            Ex. xxi, 7-11.

         </p>
         <p>
            3. Thieves not able to make restitution for their thefts, were sold
            for the benefit of the injured person. Ex. xxii, 3.

         </p>
         <p>
            4. They might be born in servitude. Ex. xxi, 4.

         </p>
         <p>
            5. If reduced to extreme poverty, a Hebrew might sell himself;
            but in such a case he was to serve, not as a bondsman, whose term
            of service was only six years, nor was he to serve as a hired servant,
            who received his wages every evening, nor yet as a sojourner or
            temporary resident in the family, but he was to serve his master until
            the year of Jubilee<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE2RC_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE2RC_FN1"></a>. Lev. xxv, 39, 40.

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE2RC_FN1"></a><a href="#FootE2RC_FN1">A</a>: If the reader will
            leave out the italicised words&#8212;But and And, in the 40th
            verse&#8212;he will find that I am fully authorized in the meaning
            I have attached to it. But and And are <em>not</em> in the original
            Hebrew; have been introduced by the translators, and
            entirely destroy the true sense of the passage.
         </p>
         <p>
            6. If a Hebrew had sold himself to a rich Gentile, he might be
            redeemed by one of his brethren at any time the money was offered;
            and he who redeemed him, was <em>not</em> to take advantage of the
            favor thus conferred, and rule over him with rigor. Lev. xxv, 47-55.

         </p>
         <p>
            Before going into an examination of the laws by which these servants
            were protected, I would just ask whether American slaves have become
            slaves in any of the ways in which the Hebrews became servants.
            Did they sell themselves into slavery and receive the purchase money
            into their own hands? No! No! Did they steal the property of
            another, and were they sold to make restitution for their crimes?
            No! Did their present masters, as an act of kindness, redeem them
            from some heathen tyrant to whom <em>they had sold themselves</em>
            in the dark hour of adversity? No! Were they born in slavery? No!
            No! Not according to <em>Jewish Law</em>, for the servants who
            were born in servitude among them, were born of parents who had
            <em>sold themselves</em>:
            Ex. xxi, 4; Lev. xxv, 39, 40. Were the female slaves of
            the South sold by their fathers? How shall I answer this question?
            Thousands and tens of thousands never were, <em>their</em> fathers
            <em>never</em> have
            received the poor compensation of silver or gold for the tears and
            toils, the suffering, and anguish, and hopeless bondage of
            <em>their</em> daughters.
            They labor day by day, and year by year, side by side, in

            the same field, if haply their daughters are permitted to remain on
            the same plantation with them, instead of being, as they often are,
            separated from their parents and sold into distant states, never again
            to meet on earth. But do the <em>fathers of the South ever sell their
               daughters?</em> My heart beats, and my hand trembles, as I write the
            awful affirmative, Yes! The fathers of this Christian land often sell
            their daughters, <em>not</em> as Jewish parents did, to be the
            wives and daughters-in-law
            of the men who buy them, but to be the abject slaves of
            petty tyrants and irresponsible masters. Is it not so, my friends? I
            leave it to your own candor to corroborate my assertion. Southern
            slaves then have <em>not</em> become slaves in any of the six
            different ways
            in which Hebrews became servants, and I hesitate not to say that
            American masters <em>cannot</em> according to <em>Jewish law</em>
            substantiate their
            claim to the men, women, or children they now hold in bondage.

         </p>
         <p>
            But there was one way in which a Jew might illegally be reduced
            to servitude; it was this, he might be <em>stolen</em> and afterwards
            sold as a
            slave, as was Joseph. To guard most effectually against this dreadful
            crime of manstealing, God enacted this severe law. "He that
            stealeth a man and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall
            surely be put to death." And again, "If a man be found stealing
            any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise
            of him, or selleth him; then <em>that thief shall die</em>; and
            thou shalt put
            away evil from among you." Deut. xxiv, 7. As I have tried American
            Slavery by <em>legal</em> Hebrew servitude, and found, (to your
            surprise,
            perhaps,) that Jewish law cannot justify the slaveholder's claim, let
            us now try it by <em>illegal</em> Hebrew bondage. Have the Southern
            slaves
            then been stolen? If they did not sell themselves into bondage; if
            they were not sold as thieves; if they were not redeemed from a
            heathen master to whom <em>they had sold themselves;</em> if they
            were not
            born in servitude according to Hebrew law; and if the females were
            not sold by their fathers as wives and daughters-in-law to those who
            purchased them; then what shall we say of them? what can we say
            of them? but that according <em>to Hebrew Law they have been stolen.</em></p>
         <p>
            But I shall be told that the Jews had other servants who were
            absolute slaves. Let us look a little into this also. They had other
            servants who were procured from the heathen.

         </p>
         <p>
            Bondmen and bondmaids might be bought of the heathen round
            about them. Lev. xxv, 44.

         </p>
         <p>
            I will now try the right of the southern planter by the claims of
            Hebrew masters to their <em>heathen</em> servants. Were the southern
            slaves bought from the heathen? No! For surely, no one will
            <em>now</em> vindicate
            the slave-trade so far as to assert that slaves were bought from
            the heathen who were obtained by that system of piracy. The only
            excuse for holding southern slaves is that they were born in slavery,
            but we have seen that they were <em>not</em> born in servitude as
            Jewish servants
            were, and that the children of heathen servants were not legally
            subjected to bondage, even under the Mosaic Law. How then have
            the slaves of the South been obtained?

         </p>
         <p>
            I will next proceed to an examination of those laws which were enacted

            in order to protect the Hebrew and the Heathen servant; for I wish
            you to understand that <em>both</em> were protected by Him, of whom
            it is said
            "his mercies are over <em>all</em> his works." I will first speak
            of those which
            secured the rights of Hebrew servants. This code was headed thus:

         </p>
         <p>
            1. Thou shalt <em>not</em> rule over him with <em>rigor</em>, but
            shalt fear thy God.

         </p>
         <p>
            2. If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve, and in the
            seventh year he shall go out free for nothing. Ex. xxi, 2. And when
            thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away
            empty: Thou shalt furnish him <em>liberally</em> out of thy flock
            and out of thy
            floor, and out of thy wine-press: of that wherewith the Lord thy God
            hath blessed thee, shalt thou give unto him. Deut. xv, 13, 14.

         </p>
         <p>
            3. If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he were
            married, then his wife shall go out with him. Ex. xxi, 3.

         </p>
         <p>
            4. If his master have given him a wife, and she have borne him sons
            and daughters, the wife and her children shall be his master's, and he
            shall go out by himself. Ex. xxi, 4.

         </p>
         <p>
            5. If the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and
            my children; I will not go out free; then his master shall bring him
            unto the Judges, and he shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post,
            and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he
            shall serve him <em>for ever</em>. Ex. xxi, 5, 6.

         </p>
         <p>
            6. If a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that
            it perish, he shall let him go <em>free</em> for his eye's sake. And
            if he smite
            out his man servant's tooth or his maid servant's tooth, he shall let
            him go <em>free</em> for his tooth's sake. Ex. xxi, 26, 27.

         </p>
         <p>
            7. On the Sabbath, rest was secured to servants by the fourth commandment.
            Ex. xx, 10.

         </p>
         <p>
            8. Servants were permitted to unite with their masters three times
            in every year in celebrating the Passover, the feast of Weeks, and the
            feast of Tabernacles; every male throughout the land was to appear
            before the Lord at Jerusalem with a gift; here the bond and the free
            stood on common ground. Deut. xvi.

         </p>
         <p>
            9. If a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die
            under his hand, he shall be surely punished. Notwithstanding, if he
            continue a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money.
            Ex. xxi, 20, 21.

         </p>
         <p>
            From these laws we learn, that one class of Hebrew men servants
            were bound to serve their masters <em>only six</em> years, unless
            their attachment
            to their employers, their wives and children, should induce them
            to wish to remain in servitude, in which case, in order to prevent the
            possibility of deception on the part of the master, the servant was first
            taken before the magistrate, where he openly declared his intention of
            continuing in his master's service, (probably a public register was kept
            of such,) he was then conducted to the door of the house, (in warm
            climates doors are thrown open.) and <em>there</em> his ear was
            <em>publicly</em> bored,
            and by submitting to this operation, he testified his willingness to serve
            him in subserviency to the law of God; for let it be remembered, that
            the door-post was covered with the precepts of that law. Deut. vi, 9.
            xi, 20: <em>for ever</em>, i.e., during his life, for Jewish Rabbins,
            who must
            have understood Jewish <em>slavery</em> (as it is called), "affirm
            that servants
            were set free at the death of their masters, and did <em>not</em>
            descend to their
            heirs;" or that he was to serve him until the year of Jubilee,
            when <em>all</em>
            servants were set at liberty. The other class, when they first sold
            themselves, agreed to remain until the year of Jubilee. To protect
            servants from violence, it was ordained, that if a master struck out
            the tooth or destroyed the eye of a servant, that servant immediately

            became <em>free</em>, for such an act of violence evidently showed
            he was unfit
            to possess the power of a master, and therefore that power was taken
            from him. All servants enjoyed the rest of the Sabbath, and partook
            of the privileges and festivities of the three great Jewish Feasts; and
            if a servant died under the infliction of chastisement, his master was
            surely to be punished. As a tooth for a tooth and life for life was the
            Jewish law, of course he was punished with death. I know that great
            stress has been laid upon the following verse: "Notwithstanding, if he
            continue a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money."

         <p>
            Slaveholders, and the apologists of slavery, have eagerly seized
            upon this little passage of Scripture, and held it up as the masters'
            Magna Charta, by which they were licensed by God himself to commit
            the greatest outrages upon the defenceless victims of their oppression.
            But, my friends, was it designed to be so? If our Heavenly Father
            would protect by law the <em>eye</em> and the
            <em>tooth</em> of a Hebrew servant, can
            we for a moment believe that he would abandon that same servant to
            the brutal rage of a master who would destroy even life itself? Let us
            then examine this passage with the help of the context. In the 18th
            and 19th verses we have a law which was made for <em>freemen</em>
            who strove
            together. Here we find, that if one man smote another, so that he
            died not, but only kept his bed from being disabled, and he rose again
            and walked abroad upon his staff, then <em>he</em> was to be paid
            for the loss
            of his time, and all the expenses of his sickness were to be borne by
            the man who smote him. The freeman's time was <em>his own</em>, and
            therefore
            he was to be remunerated for the loss of it. But <em>not</em> so with
            the <em>servant</em>, whose time was, as it were,
            <em>the money of his master</em>, because
            he had already paid for it: If he continued a day or two after being
            struck, to keep his bed in consequence of any wound received, then
            his lost time was <em>not</em> to be paid for, because it
            was <em>not his own</em>, but his
            master's, who had already paid him for it. The loss of his time was
            the <em>master's loss</em>, and <em>not</em> the servant's. This
            explanation is confirmed
            by the fact, that the Hebrew word translated continue, means "to
            stand still;" <em>i.e.</em>, to be unable to go out about his
            master's work.

         </p>
         <p>
            Here then we find this stronghold of slavery completely demolished.
            Instead of its being a license to inflict such chastisement upon a servant
            as to cause even death itself, it is in fact a law merely to provide that
            a man should not be required to pay his servant twice over for his time.
            It is altogether an unfounded assumption on the part of the slaveholder,
            that this servant <em>died</em> after a day or two; the text does not
            say so, and I contend that he <em>got well</em> after a day or two,
            just as the man mentioned
            in the 19th verse recovered from the effects of the blows he received.
            The cases are completely parallel, and the first law throws great light
            on the second. This explanation is far more consonant with the character
            of God, and were it not that our vision has been so completely
            darkened by the existence of slavery in our country, we never could
            so far have dishonored Him as to have supposed that He sanctioned
            the murder of a servant; although slaveholding legislators might legalize
            the killing of a slave in <em>four</em> different
            ways.&#8212;(<em>Stroud's Sketch of Slave Laws</em>.)

         </p>
         <p>
            But I pass on now to the consideration of how the <em>female</em> Jewish
            servants were protected by <em>law</em>.

         </p>
         <p>
            1. If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself,
            then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto another nation he
            shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.

         </p>
         <p>
            2. If he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after
            the manner of daughters.

         </p>
         <p>
            3. If he take him another wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty
            of marriage, shall he not diminish.

         </p>
         <p>
            4. If he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out
            <em>free</em> without money.

         </p>
         <p>
            On these laws I will give you Calmet's remarks; "A father could
            not sell his daughter as a slave, according to the Rabbins, until she
            was at the age of puberty, and unless he were reduced to the utmost
            indigence. Besides, when a master bought an Israelitish girl, it was
            <em>always</em> with the presumption that he would take her to wife.
            Hence
            Moses adds, 'if she please not her master, and he does not think fit
            to marry her, he shall set her at liberty,' or according to the Hebrew,
            'he shall let her be redeemed.' 'To sell her to another nation he shall
            have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her;' as to the
            engagement implied, at least of taking her to wife. 'If he have betrothed
            her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of
            daughters;' i.e., he shall take care that his son uses her as his wife,
            that he does not despise or maltreat her. If he make his son marry
            another wife, he shall give her her dowry, her clothes, and compensation
            for her virginity; if he does none of these three, she shall
            <em>go out free</em>
            without money." Thus were the <em>rights of female servants carefully
               secured by law</em> under the Jewish Dispensation; and now I would ask,
            are the rights of female slaves at the South thus secured?
            Are <em>they</em> sold only as wives and daughters-in-law, and when
            not treated as such, are they allowed to <em>go out free?</em>
            No! They have <em>all</em> not only been
            illegally obtained as servants according to Hebrew law, but they are
            also illegally <em>held</em> in bondage. Masters at the South and
            West have all forfeited their claims, (<em>if they ever had
               any,</em>) to their female slaves.

         </p>
         <p>
            We come now to examine the case of those servants who were
            "of the heathen round about;" Were <em>they</em> left entirely
            unprotected by
            law? Horne, in speaking of the law, "Thou shalt not rule over him
            with rigor, but shalt fear thy God," remarks, "this law, Lev. xxv, 43,
            it is true, speaks expressly of slaves who were of Hebrew descent;
            but as <em>alien born</em> slaves were ingrafted into the Hebrew
            Church by circumcision, <em>there is no doubt</em> but that it
            applied to <em>all</em> slaves:" if so,
            then we may reasonably suppose that the other protective laws extended
            to them also; and that the only difference between Hebrew
            and Heathen servants lay in this, that the former served but six years,
            unless they chose to remain longer, and were always freed at the
            death of their masters; whereas, the latter served until the year of
            Jubilee, though that might include a period of forty-nine years,&#8212;and
            were left from father to son.

         </p>
         <p>
            There are, however, two other laws which I have not yet noticed.
            The one effectually prevented <em>all involuntary</em> servitude,
            and the other
            completely abolished Jewish servitude every fifty years. They were
            equally operative upon the Heathen and the Hebrew.

         </p>
         <p>
            1. "Thou shalt <em>not</em> deliver unto his master
            the servant that is escaped
            from his master unto thee. He shall dwell with thee, even among
            you, in that place which he shall choose, in one of thy gates where it
            liketh him best: thou shalt <em>not</em> oppress him."
            Deut. xxiii, 15, 16.

         </p>
         <p>
            2. "And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim
            <em>Liberty</em>
            throughout <em>all</em> the land, unto <em>all</em> the
            inhabitants thereof; it shall be a
            jubilee unto you." Lev. xxv, 10.

         </p>
         <p>
            Here, then, we see that by this first law, the <em>door of Freedom was
               opened wide to every servant who</em> had any cause whatever
            for complaint;
            if he was unhappy with his master, all he had to do was to leave him,
            and <em>no man</em> had a right to deliver him back to him again,
            and not only so, but the absconded servant was to <em>choose</em>
            where he should live,

            and no Jew was permitted to oppress him. He left his master just
            as our Northern servants leave us; we have no power to compel them
            to remain with us, and no man has any right to oppress them; they
            go and dwell in that place where it chooseth them, and live just where
            they like. Is it so at the South? Is the poor runaway slave protected
            <em>by law</em> from the violence of that master whose oppression and
            cruelty has driven him from his plantation or his house? No! no!
            Even the free states of the North are compelled to deliver unto his
            master the servant that is escaped from his master into them. By
            <em>human</em> law, under the <em>Christian Dispensation</em>, in
            the <em>nineteenth century we</em> are commanded to do,
            what <em>God</em> more than <em>three thousand</em> years
            ago, under the <em>Mosaic Dispensation</em>,
            <em>positively commanded</em> the Jews
            <em>not</em> to do. In the wide domain even of our free states, there
            is not <em>one</em> city of refuge for the poor runaway fugitive;
            not one spot upon
            which he can stand and say, I am a free man&#8212;I am protected in my
            rights as a <em>man</em>, by the strong arm of the law;
            no! <em>not one</em>. How
            long the North will thus shake hands with the South in sin, I know
            not. How long she will stand by like the persecutor
            Saul, <em>consenting</em>
            unto the death of Stephen, and keeping the raiment of them that slew
            him. I know not; but one thing I do know,
            the <em>guilt of the North</em>
            is increasing in a tremendous ratio as light is pouring in upon her on
            the subject and the sin of slavery. As the sun of righteousness
            climbs higher and higher in the moral heavens, she will stand still
            more and more abashed as the query is thundered down into her ear,
            "<em>Who</em> hath required <em>this</em> at thy hand?" It will
            be found <em>no</em> excuse then
            that the Constitution of our country required that <em>persons
               bound to service</em>
            escaping from their masters should be delivered up; no more
            excuse than was the reason which Adam assigned for eating the forbidden
            fruit. <em>He was condemned and punished because</em> he hearkened
            to the voice of <em>his wife</em>, rather than to the command of his
            Maker; and <em>we</em> shall assuredly be condemned and punished
            for obeying <em>Man</em> rather than <em>God</em>, if we do not
            speedily repent and bring forth fruits meet for repentance. Yea, are we
            not receiving chastisement even <em>now</em>?

         </p>
         <p>
            But by the second of these laws a still more astonishing fact is
            disclosed. If the first effectually
            prevented <em>all involuntary servitude</em>,
            the last absolutely forbade
            even <em>voluntary servitude being perpetual</em>.
            On the great day of atonement every fiftieth year the Jubilee trumpet
            was sounded throughout the land of Judea, and <em>Liberty</em> was
            proclaimed to <em>all</em> the inhabitants thereof. I will not say
            that the servants' <em>chains</em> fell off and their
            <em>manacles</em> were burst, for there is no evidence
            that Jewish servants <em>ever</em> felt the weight of iron
            chains, and collars,
            and handcuffs; but I do say that even the man who had voluntarily
            sold himself and the <em>heathen</em> who had been sold to a
            Hebrew master,
            were set free, the one as well as the other. This law was evidently
            designed to prevent the oppression of the poor, and the possibility of
            such a thing as <em>perpetual servitude</em> existing among them.

         </p>
         <p>
            Where, then, I would ask, is the warrant, the justification, or the
            palliation of American Slavery from Hebrew servitude? How many
            of the southern slaves would now be in bondage according to the

            laws of Moses; Not one. You may observe that I have carefully
            avoided using the term <em>slavery</em> when speaking of Jewish
            servitude; and simply for this reason, that <em>no such thing</em>
            existed among that people; the word translated servant does
            <em>not</em> mean <em>slave</em>, it is the
            same that is applied to Abraham, to Moses, to Elisha and the prophets
            generally. <em>Slavery</em> then <em>never</em> existed under
            the Jewish Dispensation at all, and I cannot but regard it as an
            aspersion on the character of Him who is "glorious in Holiness" for any
            one to assert that "<em>God sanctioned, yea commanded slavery</em>
            under the old dispensation."
            I would fain lift my feeble voice to vindicate Jehovah's
            character from so foul a slander. If slaveholders are determined to
            hold slaves as long as they can, let them not dare to say that the
            God of mercy and of truth <em>ever</em> sanctioned such a system
            of cruelty and wrong. It is blasphemy against Him.

         </p>
         <p>
            We have seen that the code of laws framed by Moses with regard
            to servants was designed to <em>protect them</em> as
            <em>men and women</em>, to secure
            to them their <em>rights</em> as <em>human beings</em>, to
            guard them from oppression
            and defend them from violence of every kind. Let us now turn to
            the Slave laws of the South and West and examine them too. I will
            give you the substance only, because I fear I shall trespass too
            much on your time, were I to quote them at length.

         </p>
         <p>
            1. <em>Slavery</em> is hereditary and perpetual, to the last moment
            of the slave's earthly existence, and to all his descendants to the latest
            posterity.

         </p>

            2. The labor of the slave is compulsory and uncompensated;
            while the kind of labor, the amount of toil, the time allowed for rest,
            are dictated solely by the master. No bargain is made, no wages
            given. A pure despotism governs the human brute; and even his
            covering and provender, both as to quantity and quality, depend entirely
            on the master's discretion<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE2RC_FN2"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE2RC_FN2"></a>.

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE2RC_FN2"></a><a href="#FootE2RC_FN2">A</a>: There are laws in
            some of the slave states, limiting the labor which the master
            may require of the slave to fourteen hours daily. In some of the
            states there are laws requiring the masters to furnish a certain
            amount of food and clothing, as for instance, <em>one quart</em>
            of corn per day, or <em>one peck</em> per week, or
            <em>one bushel</em> per month,
            and "<em>one</em> linen shirt and pantaloons for the summer,
            and a linen shirt and woolen
            great coat and pantaloons for the winter," &amp;c. But "still," to
            use the language of Judge Stroud "the slave is entirely under the
            control of his master.&#8212;is unprovided
            with a protector,&#8212;and, especially as he cannot be a witness
            or make complaint in
            any known mode against his master, the <em>apparent</em> object of
            these laws may <em>always</em> be defeated." ED.
         </p>
         <p>
            3. The slave being considered a personal chattel may be sold or
            pledged, or leased at the will of his master. He may be exchanged
            for marketable commodities, or taken in execution for the debts or
            taxes either of a living or dead master. Sold at auction, either
            individually, or in lots to suit the purchaser, he may remain with his
            family, or be separated from them for ever.

         </p>
         <p>
            4. Slaves can make no contracts and have no <em>legal</em> right to any
            property, real or personal. Their own honest earnings and the legacies
            of friends belong in point of law to their masters.

         </p>
         <p>
            5. Neither a slave nor a free colored person can be a witness

            against any <em>white</em>, or free person, in a court of justice,
            however atrocious
            may have been the crimes they have seen him commit, if such
            testimony would be for the benefit of a <em>slave</em>; but they
            may give testimony <em>against a fellow slave</em>, or free colored
            man, even in cases
            affecting life, if the <em>master</em> is to reap the advantage of it.

         </p>
         <p>
            6. The slave may be punished at his master's discretion&#8212;without
            trial&#8212;without any means of legal redress; whether his offence be
            real or imaginary; and the master can transfer the same despotic
            power to any person or persons, he may choose to appoint.

         </p>
         <p>
            7. The slave is not allowed to resist any free man under <em>any</em>
            circumstances, <em>his</em> only safety consists in the fact that
            his <em>owner</em> may
            bring suit and recover the price of his body, in case his life is taken,
            or his limbs rendered unfit for labor.

         </p>
         <p>
            8. Slaves cannot redeem themselves, or obtain a change of masters, though
            cruel treatment may have rendered such a change necessary
            for their personal safety.

         </p>
         <p>
            9. The slave is entirely unprotected in his domestic relations.

         </p>
         <p>
            10. The laws greatly obstruct the manumission of slaves, even
            where the master is willing to enfranchise them.

         </p>
         <p>
            11. The operation of the laws tends to deprive slaves of religious
            instruction and consolation.

         </p>
         <p>
            12. The whole power of the laws is exerted to keep slaves in a
            state of the lowest ignorance.

         </p>
         <p>
            13. There is in this country a monstrous inequality of law and
            right. What is a trifling fault in the <em>white</em> man, is
            considered highly criminal in the <em>slave</em>; the same
            offences which cost a white man a
            few dollars only, are punished in the negro with death.

         </p>
         <p>
            14. The laws operate most oppressively upon free people of
            color<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE2RC_FN3"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE2RC_FN3"></a>.

            Shall I ask you now my friends, to draw the <em>parallel</em>
            between Jewish <em>servitude</em> and American <em>slavery</em>?
            No! For there is <em>no likeness</em>
            in the two systems; I ask you rather to mark the contrast. The
            laws of Moses <em>protected servants</em> in their
            <em>rights</em> as <em>men and women</em>,
            guarded them from oppression and defended them from wrong. The
            Code Noir of the South <em>robs the slave of all his rights</em> as
            a <em>man</em>, reduces him to a chattel personal, and defends the
            <em>master</em> in the exercise
            of the most unnatural and unwarrantable power over his slave.
            They each bear the impress of the hand which formed them. The
            attributes of justice and mercy are shadowed out in the Hebrew
            code; those of injustice and cruelty, in the Code Noir of America.
            Truly it was wise in the slaveholders of the South to declare their
            slaves to be "chattels personal;" for before they could be robbed
            of wages, wives, children, and friends, it was absolutely necessary to
            deny they were human beings. It is wise in them, to keep them in
            abject ignorance, for the strong man armed must be bound before we
            can spoil his house&#8212;the powerful intellect of man must be bound
            down with the iron chains of nescience before we can rob him of his
            rights as a man; we must reduce him to a <em>thing</em> before
            we can claim

            the right to set our feet upon his neck, because it was only
            <em>all things</em>
            which were originally <em>put under the feet of man</em> by the
            Almighty and Beneficent Father of all, who has declared himself to
            be <em>no respecter</em> of persons, whether red, white or black.

         </p>
         <p>
            But some have even said that Jesus Christ did not condemn slavery.
            To this I reply that our Holy Redeemer lived and preached
            among the Jews only. The laws which Moses had enacted fifteen
            hundred years previous to his appearance among them, had never
            been annulled, and these laws protected every servant in Palestine.
            If then He did not condemn Jewish servitude this does not prove
            that he would not have condemned such a monstrous system as that
            of American <em>slavery</em>, if that had existed among them. But
            did not Jesus condemn slavery? Let us examine some of his precepts.
            "<em>Whatsoever</em> ye would that men should do to you,
            do <em>ye even so to them</em>." Let every slaveholder apply these
            queries to his own heart;
            Am <em>I</em> willing to be a slave&#8212;Am <em>I</em> willing
            to see my wife the slave of another&#8212;Am <em>I</em> willing to
            see my mother a slave, or my father, my sister or my brother? If not,
            then in holding others as slaves, I am doing what I would <em>not</em>
            wish to be done to me or any relative I have; and thus have I broken
            this golden rule which was given <em>me</em> to walk by.

         </p>
         <p>
            But some slaveholders have said, "we were never in bondage to
            any man," and therefore the yoke of bondage would be insufferable
            to us, but slaves are accustomed to it, their backs are fitted to the
            burden. Well, I am willing to admit that you who have lived in freedom
            would find slavery even more oppressive than the poor slave
            does, but then you may try this question in another form&#8212;Am I willing
            to reduce <em>my little child</em> to slavery? You know
            that <em>if it is brought up a slave</em> it will never know any
            contrast, between freedom
            and bondage, its back will become fitted to the burden just as the
            negro child's does&#8212;<em>not by nature</em>&#8212;but by daily,
            violent pressure, in
            the same way that the head of the Indian child becomes flattened by
            the boards in which it is bound. It has been justly remarked that
            "<em>God never made a slave</em>," he made man upright; his back
            was <em>not</em> made to carry burdens, nor his neck to wear a yoke,
            and the <em>man</em> must be crushed within him, before
            <em>his</em> back can be <em>fitted</em> to the burden
            of perpetual slavery; and that his back is <em>not</em> fitted to it,
            is manifest by the insurrections that so often disturb the peace and
            security of slaveholding countries. Who ever heard of a rebellion of the
            beasts of the field; and why not? simply because <em>they</em> were
            all placed <em>under the feet of man</em>, into whose hand they
            were delivered; it was originally designed that they should serve him,
            therefore their necks have been formed for the yoke, and their backs
            for the burden; but <em>not so with man</em>, intellectual,
            immortal man! I appeal to you, my friends, as mothers; Are you willing
            to enslave <em>your</em> children? You start back with horror and
            indignation at such a question. But why, if slavery is <em>no wrong</em>
            to those upon whom it is imposed? why, if
            as has often been said, slaves are happier than their masters, free
            from the cares and perplexities of providing for themselves and their
            <em>wanting</em>? Try yourselves by another of the Divine precepts,
            "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Can we love a man <em>as</em>
            we love <em>ourselves if we do, and continue to do</em> unto him,
            what we would not
            wish any one to do to us? Look, too, at Christ's example, what does
            he say of himself, "I came <em>not</em> to be ministered unto, but
            to minister."
            Can you for a moment imagine the meek and lowly, and compassionate
            Saviour, <em>a slaveholder</em>? Do you not shudder at this thought
            as much as at that of his being <em>a warrior</em>? But why, if
            slavery is not sinful?

         </p>
         <p>
            Again, it has been said, the Apostle Paul did not condemn slavery,
            for he sent Onesimus back to Philemon. I do not think it can be
            said he sent him back, for no coercion was made use of. Onesimus
            was not thrown into prison and then sent back in chains to his master,
            as your runaway slaves often are&#8212;this could not possibly have been
            the case, because you know Paul as a Jew, was <em>bound to protect</em>
            the runaway; <em>he had no right</em> to send <em>any</em> fugitive
            back to his master.
            The state of the case then seems to have been this. Onesimus had
            been an unprofitable servant to Philemon and left him&#8212;he afterwards
            became converted under the Apostle's preaching, and seeing that he
            had been to blame in his conduct, and desiring by future fidelity to
            atone for past error, he wished to return, and the Apostle gave him
            the letter we now have as a recommendation to Philemon, informing
            him of the conversion of Onesimus, and entreating him as "Paul the
            aged" "to receive him, <em>not</em> now as a <em>servant</em>,
            but <i>above</i> a servant, a <em>brother
               beloved</em>, especially to me, but how much more unto thee,
            both in the flesh and in the Lord. If thou count <em>me</em> therefore
            as a partner, <em>receive him as myself</em>." This, then, surely
            cannot be forced
            into a justification of the practice of returning runaway slaves back
            to their masters, to be punished with cruel beatings and scourgings
            as they often are. Besides the word <em>doulos</em> here translated
            servant, is the same that is made use of in Matt. xviii, 27. Now it appears
            that this servant <em>owed</em> his lord ten thousand talents;
            he possessed property to a vast amount. And what is still more
            surprising, if he was a <em>slave</em>, is, that "forasmuch as he
            had not to pay, his lord commanded <em>him</em> to be sold, and his
            wife and children, and all that he
            had, and payment to be made." Whoever heard of a slaveholder
            selling a <em>slave</em> and his family to pay himself a debt due to
            him from a <em>slave</em>? What would he gain by it when the slave is
            himself his <em>property</em>, and his wife and children also? Onesimus
            could not, then, have been a <em>slave</em>, for slaves do not own
            their wives or children; no,
            not even their own bodies, much less property. But again, the servitude
            which the apostle was accustomed to, must have been very different from
            American slavery, for he says, "the heir (or son), as long as
            he is a child, differeth <em>nothing from a servant</em>, though he
            be lord of all.
            But is under <em>tutors</em> and governors until the time appointed
            of the father."
            From this it appears, that the means of <em>instruction</em> were
            provided for <em>servants</em> as well as children; and indeed we
            know it must have been
            so among the Jews, because their servants were not permitted to
            remain in perpetual bondage, and therefore it was absolutely necessary
            they should be prepared to occupy higher stations in society

            than those of servants. Is it so at the South, my friends? Is the
            daily bread of instruction provided for <em>your slaves</em>? are
            their minds
            enlightened, and they gradually prepared to rise from the grade of
            menials into that of <em>free</em>, independent members of the state?
            Let your own statute book, and your own daily experience, answer these
            questions.

         </p>
         <p>
            If this apostle sanctioned <em>slavery</em>, why did he exhort masters
            thus in his epistle to the Ephesians, "and ye, masters, do the same things
            unto them (i.e. perform your duties to your servants as unto Christ,
            not unto men) <em>forbearing threatening</em>; knowing that your master
            also is in heaven, neither is
            <em>there respect of persons with him</em>." And in
            Colossians, "Masters give unto your servants that which is <em>just and
               equal</em>, knowing that ye also have a master in heaven." Let
            slaveholders
            only <em>obey</em> these injunctions of Paul, and I am satisfied slavery
            would soon be abolished. If he thought it sinful even to
            <em>threaten</em>
            servants, surely he must have thought it sinful to flog and to beat
            them with sticks and paddles; indeed, when delineating the character
            of a bishop, he expressly names this as one feature of it,
            "<em>no striker</em>."
            Let masters give unto their servants that which is <em>just</em>
            and <i>equal</i>, and
            all that vast system of unrequited labor would crumble into ruin.
            Yes, and if they once felt they had no right to the <em>labor</em> of
            their servants
            without pay, surely they could not think they had a right to
            their wives, their children, and their own bodies. Again, how can it
            be said Paul sanctioned slavery, when, as though to put this matter
            beyond all doubt, in that black catalogue of sins enumerated in his
            first epistle to Timothy, he mentions "<i>menstealers</i>," which
            word may be translated "<i>slavedealers</i>." But you
            may say, we all despise slavedealers
            as much as any one can; they are never admitted into genteel
            or respectable society. And why not? Is it not because even you
            shrink back from the idea of associating with those who make their
            fortunes by trading in the bodies and souls of men, women, and children?
            whose daily work it is to break human hearts, by tearing wives
            from their husbands, and children from their parents? But why hold
            slavedealers as despicable, if their trade is lawful and virtuous? and
            why despise them more than the <em>gentlemen of fortune and
               standing</em> who employ them as <em>their</em> agents? Why more
            than the <em>professors of religion</em> who barter their
            fellow-professors to them for gold and silver?
            We do not despise the land agent, or the physician, or the merchant,
            and why? Simply because their processions are virtuous and honorable;
            and if the trade of men-jobbers was honorable, you would not
            despise them either. There is no difference in <em>principle</em>,
            in <i>Christian ethics</i>, between the despised
            slavedealer and the <i>Christian</i> who buys
            slaves from, or sells slaves to him; indeed, if slaves were not wanted
            by the respectable, the wealthy, and the religious in a community,
            there would be no slaves in that community, and of course no
            <em>slavedealers</em>.
            It is then the <em>Christians</em> and the <em>honorable men</em>
            and <em>women</em> of the South, who are the <em>main pillars</em>
            of this grand temple built to Mammon and to Moloch. It is the
            <em>most enlightened</em>, in every country
            who are <em>most</em> to blame when any public sin is supported by
            public

            opinion, hence Isaiah says, "<em>When</em> the Lord hath performed his
            whole work upon mount <em>Zion</em> and on <em>Jerusalem</em>,
            (then) I will punish
            the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his
            high looks." And was it not so? Open the historical records of
            that age, was not Israel carried into captivity B.C. 721, Judah B.C.
            588, and the stout heart of the heathen monarchy not punished until
            B.C. 536, fifty-two years <em>after</em> Judah's, and 185 years,
            <em>after</em> Israel's captivity, when it was overthrown by Cyrus,
            king of Persia?
            Hence, too, the apostle Peter says, "judgment must <em>begin at the
               house of God</em>." Surely this would not be the case, if the
            <em>professors of religion</em> were not <em>most worthy</em> of
            blame.

         </p>
         <p>
            But it may be asked, why are <em>they</em> most culpable? I will tell
            you, my friends. It is because sin is imputed to us just in proportion to
            the spiritual light we receive. Thus the prophet Amos says, in the
            name of Jehovah, "<em>You only</em> have I known of all the families
            of the earth: <em>therefore</em> I will punish <em>you</em> for
            all your iniquities." Hear too the doctrine of our Lord on this important
            subject: "The servant who <em>knew</em> his Lord's will and
            <em>prepared not</em> himself, neither did according
            to his will, shall be beaten with <em>many stripes</em>:" and why?
            "For unto whomsoever <em>much</em> is given, <em>of him</em>
            shall <em>much</em> be required;
            and to whom men have committed <em>much</em>, of <em>him</em> they
            will ask the
            <em>more</em>." Oh! then that the <em>Christians</em> of the south
            would ponder these
            things in their hearts, and awake to the vast responsibilities which
            rest <em>upon them</em> at this important crisis.

         </p>
         <p>
            I have thus, I think, clearly proved to you seven propositions, viz.:
            First, that slavery is contrary to the declaration of our independence.
            Second, that it is contrary to the first charter of human rights given
            to Adam, and renewed to Noah. Third, that the fact of slavery
            having been the subject of prophecy, furnishes <em>no</em> excuse
            whatever to
            slaveholders. Fourth, that no such system existed under the patriarchal
            dispensation. Fifth, that <em>slavery never</em> existed under the
            Jewish
            dispensation; but so far otherwise, that every servant was placed
            under the <em>protection of law</em>, and care taken not only to
            prevent all
            <em>involuntary</em> servitude, but all <em>voluntary perpetual</em>
            bondage. Sixth, that slavery in America reduces a <em>man</em> to a
            <em>thing</em>, a "chattel personal," <em>robs him</em> of
            <em>all</em> his rights as a <em>human being</em>, fetters both his
            mind and body, and protects the <em>master</em> in the most unnatural
            and unreasonable power, whilst it <em>throws him out</em> of the
            protection of law.
            Seventh, that slavery is contrary to the example and precepts of our
            holy and merciful Redeemer, and of his apostles.

         </p>
         <p>
            But perhaps you will be ready to query, why appeal to <em>women</em> on
            this subject? <em>We</em> do not make the laws which perpetuate
            slavery. <em>No</em> legislative power is vested in <em>us; we</em>
            can do nothing to overthrow the system, even if we wished to do so. To
            this I reply, I know you do not make the laws, but I also know that
            <em>you are the wives and mothers, the sisters and daughters of those
               who do</em>; and if you really
            suppose <em>you</em> can do nothing to overthrow slavery, you are
            greatly mistaken. You can do much in every way: four things I will name.
            1st. You can read on this subject. 2d. You can pray over this subject.

            3d. You can speak on this subject. 4th. You can act on this subject. I have
            not placed reading before praying because I regard
            it more important, but because, in order to pray right, we must
            understand what we are praying for; it is only then we can "pray with
            the understanding and the spirit also."

         </p>
         <p>
            1. Read then on the subject of slavery. Search the Scriptures
            daily, whether the things I have told you are true. Other books and
            papers might be a great help to you in this investigation, but they are
            not necessary, and it is hardly probable that your Committees of Vigilance
            will allow you to have any other. The <em>Bible</em> then is the book
            I want you to read in the spirit of inquiry, and the spirit of prayer.
            Even the enemies of Abolitionists, acknowledge that their doctrines
            are drawn from it. In the great mob in Boston, last autumn, when the books
            and papers of the Anti-Slavery Society, were thrown out
            of the windows of their office, one individual laid hold of the Bible
            and was about tossing it out to the crowd, when another reminded
            him that it was the Bible he had in his hand. <em>"Oh! 'tis all
               one,"</em> he replied, and out went the sacred volume, along with the
            rest. We thank him for the acknowledgment. <em>Yes, "it is all
               one,"</em> for our books and papers are mostly commentaries on the
            Bible, and the Declaration. Read the <em>Bible</em> then; it
            contains the words of Jesus, and they are spirit and life. Judge for
            yourselves whether <em>he sanctioned</em> such a system of
            oppression and crime.

         </p>
         <p>
            2. Pray over this subject. When you have entered into your
            closets, and shut to the doors, then pray to your father, who seeth in
            secret, that he would open your eyes to see whether slavery is
            <em>sinful</em>, and if it is, that he would enable you to bear
            a faithful, open and unshrinking
            testimony against it, and to do whatsoever your hands find
            to do, leaving the consequences entirely to him, who still says to us
            whenever we try to reason away duty from the fear of consequences,
            <em>"What is that to thee, follow thou me."</em> Pray also for the
            poor slave,
            that he may be kept patient and submissive under his hard lot, until
            God is pleased to open the door of freedom to him without violence
            or bloodshed. Pray too for the master that his heart may be softened,
            and he made willing to acknowledge, as Joseph's brethren did, "Verily
            we are guilty concerning our brother," before he will be compelled to
            add in consequence of Divine judgment, "therefore is all this evil
            come upon us." Pray also for all your brethren and sisters who are
            laboring in the righteous cause of Emancipation in the Northern
            States, England and the world. There is great encouragement for
            prayer in these words of our Lord. "Whatsoever ye shall ask the
            Father in any name, he will give it to you"&#8212;Pray then without ceasing,
            in the closet and the social circle.

         </p>
         <p>
            3. Speak on this subject. It is through the tongue, the pen, and
            the press, that truth is principally propagated. Speak then to your
            relatives, your friends, your acquaintances on the subject of slavery;
            be not afraid if you are conscientiously convinced it is
            <em>sinful</em>, to say so openly, but calmly, and to let your
            sentiments be known. If you
            are served by the slaves of others, try to ameliorate their condition as

            much as possible; never aggravate their faults, and thus add fuel to
            the fire of anger already kindled, in a master and mistress's bosom;
            remember their extreme ignorance, and consider them as your Heavenly
            Father does the <em>less</em> culpable on this account, even when they
            do wrong things. Discountenance <em>all</em> cruelty to them, all
            starvation, all corporal chastisement; these may brutalize and
            <em>break</em> their spirits,
            but will never bend them to willing, cheerful obedience. If possible,
            see that they are comfortably and <em>seasonably</em> fed, whether
            in the house
            or the field; it is unreasonable and cruel to expect slaves to wait for
            their breakfast until eleven o'clock, when they rise at five or six. Do
            all you can, to induce their owners to clothe them well, and to allow
            them many little indulgences which would contribute to their comfort.
            Above all, try to persuade your husband, father, brothers and sons,
            that <em>slavery is a crime against God and man</em>, and that it
            is a great sin
            to keep <em>human beings</em> in such abject ignorance; to deny
            them the privilege of learning to read and write. The Catholics are
            universally condemned, for denying the Bible to the common people, but,
            <em>slaveholders must not</em> blame them, for <em>they</em> are
            doing the <i>very same
               thing</i>, and for the very same reason, neither of these systems can
            bear the light which bursts from the pages of that Holy Book. And
            lastly, endeavour to inculcate submission on the part of the slaves,
            but whilst doing this be faithful in pleading the cause of the oppressed.

            <h3><a name="projectID3ec2855c3002e-div-d0e3791"></a></h3>
            <div class="lg">"Will <em>you</em> behold unheeding, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Life's holiest feelings crushed, <br>Where <em>woman's</em> heart is bleeding, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall <em>woman's</em> voice be hushed?"<br><br></div>
         </div>
         <p>
            4. Act on this subject. Some of you <em>own</em> slaves yourselves. If
            you believe slavery is <em>sinful</em>, set them at liberty, "undo the
            heavy burdens and let the oppressed go free." If they wish to remain with
            you, pay them wages, if not, let them leave you. Should they remain,
            teach them, and have them taught the common branches of an English
            education; they have minds, and those minds <em>ought to be
               improved</em>. So precious a talent as intellect, never was given to
            be wrapt in a napkin and buried in the earth. It is the <em>duty</em>
            of all, as far as they can, to improve their own mental faculties, because
            we are commanded to love God with <em>all our minds</em>, as well as
            with all our hearts, and we commit a great sin, if we
            <em>forbid or prevent</em> that cultivation of
            the mind in others, which would enable them to perform this duty.
            Teach your servants, then, to read, &amp;c., and encourage them to believe
            it is their <em>duty</em> to learn, if it were only that they might
            read the Bible.

         </p>
         <p>
            But some of you will say, we can neither free our slaves nor teach
            them to read, for the laws of our state forbid it. Be not surprised
            when I say such wicked laws <em>ought to be no barrier</em> in the
            way of your
            duty, and I appeal to the Bible to prove this position. What was the
            conduct of Shiprah and Puah, when the king of Egypt issued his cruel
            mandate, with regard to the Hebrew children? "<em>They</em> feared
            <em>God</em>, and did <em>not</em> as the King of Egypt commanded
            them, but saved the men children alive." And be it remembered, that it was
            through <em>their</em> faithfulness
            that Moses was preserved. This great and immediate emancipator
            was indebted to a <em>woman</em> for his spared life, and he became
            a blessing to the whole Jewish nation. Did these <em>women</em> do
            right

            in disobeying that monarch? "<em>Therefore</em> (says the sacred text,)
            <i>God
               dealt well</i> with them, and made them houses" Ex. i. What was the
            conduct of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, when Nebuchadnezzar
            set up a golden image in the plain of Dura, and commanded all
            people, nations, and languages, to fall down and worship it? "Be it
            known, unto thee, (said these faithful <em>Jews</em>) O king, that
            <em>we will not</em>
            serve thy gods, nor worship the image which thou hast set up." Did
            these men <em>do right in disobeying the law</em> of their sovereign?
            Let their
            miraculous deliverance from the burning fiery furnace, answer; Dan.
            iii. What was the conduct of Daniel, when Darius made a firm decree
            that no one should ask a petition of any man or God for thirty days?
            Did the prophet cease to pray? No! "When Daniel <em>knew that the
               writing was signed</em>, he went into his house, and his windows being
            <em>open</em> towards Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a
            day, and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime."
            Did Daniel do right thus to <em>break</em> the law of his king? Let
            his wonderful deliverance out of the mouths of the lions answer;
            Dan. vii. Look, too, at the Apostles Peter and John. When the
            rulers of the Jews, "<em>commanded them not</em> to speak at all, nor
            teach in the name of Jesus," what did they say? "Whether it be right in
            the sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge
            ye." And what did they do? "They spake the word of God with
            boldness, and with great power gave the Apostles witness of the
            <em>resurrection</em> of the Lord Jesus;" although <em>this</em>
            was the very doctrine, for the preaching of which, they had just been cast
            into prison, and further threatened. Did these men do right? I leave
            <em>you</em> to answer, who now enjoy the benefits of their labors
            and sufferings, in that Gospel they dared to preach when positively
            commanded <em>not to teach any more</em> in the name of Jesus; Acts iv.

         </p>
         <p>
            But some of you may say, if we do free our slaves, they will be
            taken up and sold, therefore there will be no use in doing it. Peter
            and John might just as well have said, we will not preach the gospel,
            for if we do, we shall be taken up and put in prison, therefore there
            will be no use in our preaching. <em>Consequences</em>, my friends,
            belong no more to <em>you</em>, than they did to these apostles. Duty
            is ours and events are God's. If you think slavery is sinful, all
            <em>you</em> have to do is to set your slaves at liberty, do all you
            can to protect them, and in humble faith and fervent prayer, commend them
            to your common Father. He can take care of them; but if for wise purposes
            he sees fit to allow them to be sold, this will afford you an opportunity
            of testifying openly, wherever you go, against the crime of
            <i>manstealing</i>. Such an act will be <em>clear
               robbery</em>, and if exposed, might, under the Divine
            direction, do the cause of Emancipation more good, than any thing
            that could happen, for, "He makes even the wrath of man to praise
            him, and the remainder of wrath he will restrain."

         </p>
         <p>
            I know that this doctrine of obeying <em>God</em>, rather than man,
            will be considered as dangerous, and heretical by many, but I am not afraid
            openly to avow it, because it is the doctrine of the Bible; but I would
            not be understood to advocate resistance to any law however oppressive,

            if, in obeying it, I was not obliged to commit <em>sin</em>. If for
            instance, there was a law, which imposed imprisonment or a fine
            upon me if I manumitted a slave, I would on no account resist that
            law, I would set the slave free, and then go to prison or suffer the
            penalty. If a law commands me to <em>sin I will break it</em>; if it
            calls me to <em>suffer</em>, I will let it take its
            course <i>unresistingly</i>. The doctrine of
            blind obedience and unqualified submission to <em>any human</em> power,
            whether civil or ecclesiastical, is the doctrine of despotism, and ought
            to have no place among Republicans and Christians.

         </p>
         <p>
            But you will perhaps say, such a course of conduct would inevitably expose
            us to great suffering. Yes! my christian friends, I believe it would, but
            this will <em>not</em> excuse you or any one else for the
            neglect of <em>duty</em>. If Prophets and Apostles, Martyrs, and
            Reformers had not been willing to suffer for the truth's sake, where would
            the world have been now? If they had said, we cannot speak the truth,
            we cannot do what we believe is right, because the
            <em>laws of our country or public opinion are against us</em>, where
            would our holy religion have been now? The Prophets were stoned, imprisoned,
            and killed by the Jews. And why? Because they exposed and openly rebuked
            public sins; they opposed public opinion; had they held their peace,
            they all might have lived in ease and died in favor with a wicked
            generation. Why were the Apostles persecuted from city to city, stoned,
            incarcerated, beaten, and crucified? Because they dared to <em>speak the
               truth</em>; to tell the Jews, boldly and fearlessly, that
            <em>they</em> were the <em>murderers</em> of the Lord of Glory,
            and that, however great a stumbling-block the Cross might be to them, there
            was no other name given under heaven by which men could be saved, but the
            name of Jesus. Because they declared, even at Athens, the seat of learning
            and refinement, the self-evident truth, that "they be no gods that are made
            with men's hands", and exposed to the Grecians the foolishness of
            worldly wisdom, and the impossibility of salvation but through Christ,
            whom they despised on account of the ignominious death he died.
            Because at Rome, the proud mistress of the world, they thundered
            out the terrors of the law upon that idolatrous, war-making, and
            slave-holding community. Why were the martyrs stretched upon the
            rack, gibbetted and burnt, the scorn and diversion of a Nero, whilst
            their tarred and burning bodies sent up a light which illuminated the
            Roman capital? Why were the Waldenses hunted like wild beasts
            upon the mountains of Piedmont, and slain with the sword of the
            Duke of Savoy and the proud monarch of France? Why were the
            Presbyterians chased like the partridge over the highlands of
            Scotland&#8212;the Methodists pumped, and stoned, and pelted with rotten
            eggs&#8212;the Quakers incarcerated in filthy prisons, beaten, whipped at
            the cart's tail, banished and hung? Because they dared to <em>speak</em>
            the <em>truth</em>, to <em>break</em> the unrighteous
            <em>laws</em> of their country, and chose rather to suffer affliction
            with the people of God, "not accepting deliverance," even under the
            gallows. Why were Luther and Calvin persecuted and excommunicated, Cranmer,
            Ridley, and Latimer burnt? Because they fearlessly proclaimed the truth,
            though that truth was

            contrary to public opinion, and the authority of Ecclesiastical councils
            and conventions. Now all this vast amount of human suffering
            might have been saved. All these Prophets and Apostles, Martyrs,
            and Reformers, might have lived and died in peace with all men, but
            following the example of their great pattern, "they despised the
            shame, endured the cross, and are now set down on the right hand
            of the throne of God," having received the glorious welcome of "well
            <em>done</em> good and faithful servants, enter ye into the joy
            of your Lord."

         </p>

            But you may say we are <em>women</em>, how can <em>our</em> hearts
            endure persecution? And why not? Have not <em>women</em> arisen in
            all the dignity and strength of moral courage to be the leaders of the
            people, and to bear a faithful testimony for the truth whenever the
            providence of God has called them to do so? Are there no <em>women</em>
            in that noble army of martyrs who are now singing the song of Moses and the
            Lamb? Who led out the women of Israel from the house of bondage, striking
            the timbrel, and singing the song of deliverance on the banks of that sea
            whose waters stood up like walls of crystal to open a passage for their
            escape? It was a <em>woman</em>; Miriam, the prophetess,
            the sister of Moses and Aaron. Who went up with Barak to
            Kadesh to fight against Jabin, King of Canaan, into whose hand
            Israel had been sold because of their iniquities? It was a
            <em>woman</em>! Deborah the wife of Lapidoth, the judge, as well as
            the prophetess of that backsliding people; Judges iv, 9. Into whose hands
            was Sisera, the captain of Jabin's host delivered? Into the hand of a
            <em>woman</em>. Jael the wife of Heber! Judges vi, 21. Who dared to
            <em>speak the truth</em> concerning those judgments which were coming
            upon Judea, when Josiah, alarmed at finding that his people "had not kept
            the word of the Lord to do after all that was written in the book of
            the Law," sent to enquire of the Lord concerning these things? It
            was a <em>woman</em>. Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum; 2,
            Chron. xxxiv, 22. Who was chosen to deliver the whole Jewish
            nation from that murderous decree of Persia's King, which wicked
            Haman had obtained by calumny and fraud? It was a <em>woman</em>;
            Esther the Queen; yes, weak and trembling <em>woman</em> was the
            instrument appointed by God, to reverse the bloody mandate of the eastern
            monarch, and save the <em>whole visible church</em> from destruction.
            What human voice first proclaimed to Mary that she should be the mother
            of our Lord? It was a <em>woman</em>! Elizabeth, the wife of Zacharias;
            Luke i, 42, 43. Who united with the good old Simeon in giving
            thanks publicly in the temple, when the child, Jesus, was presented
            there by his parents, "and spake of him to all them that looked for
            redemption in Jerusalem?" It was a <em>woman</em>! Anna the prophetess.
            Who first proclaimed Christ as the true Messiah in the streets of Samaria,
            once the capital of the ten tribes? It was a <em>woman</em>! Who
            ministered to the Son of God whilst on earth, a despised and persecuted
            Reformer, in the humble garb of a carpenter? They were
            <em>women</em>! Who followed the rejected King of Israel, as his
            fainting footsteps trod the road to Calvary? "A great company of people
            and of <em>women</em>;" and it is remarkable that to
            <em>them alone</em>, he turned

            and addressed the pathetic language, "Daughters of Jerusalem
            weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and your children." Ah!
            who sent unto the Roman Governor when he was set down on the
            judgment seat, saying unto him, "Have thou nothing to do with that
            just man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because
            of him?" It was a <em>woman</em>! the wife of Pilate.
            Although "<em>he knew</em> that for envy the Jews had delivered
            Christ," yet <em>he</em> consented to surrender the Son of God into
            the hands of a brutal soldiery, after having himself scourged his naked
            body. Had the <em>wife</em> of Pilate sat upon that judgment seat,
            what would have been the result of the trial of this "just person?"

         </p>
         <p>
            And who last hung round the cross of Jesus on the mountain
            of Golgotha? Who first visited the sepulchre early in the morning
            on the first day of the week, carrying sweet spices to embalm his
            precious body, not knowing that it was incorruptible and could not
            be holden by the bands of death? These were <em>women</em>! To whom
            did he <em>first</em> appear after his resurrection? It was to a
            <em>woman</em>! Mary Magdalene; Mark xvi, 9. Who gathered with the
            apostles to wait at Jerusalem, in prayer and supplication, for "the
            promise of the Father;" the spiritual blessing of the Great High Priest
            of his Church, who had entered, <em>not</em> into the splendid
            temple of Solomon, there to offer the blood of bulls, and of goats, and
            the smoking censer upon the golden altar, but into Heaven itself, there
            to present his intercessions, after having "given himself for us, an
            offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor?"
            <em>Women</em> were among that holy company; Acts i, 14. And did
            <em>women</em> wait in vain? Did those who had ministered to his
            necessities, followed in his train, and wept at his crucifixion, wait
            in vain? No! No! Did the cloven tongues of fire descend upon the heads
            of <em>women</em> as well as men? Yes, my friends, "it sat upon
            <em>each one of them</em>;" Acts ii, 3. <em>Women</em>
            as well as men were to be living stones in the temple of grace,
            and therefore <em>their</em> heads were consecrated by the descent of
            the Holy Ghost as well as those of men. Were <em>women</em> recognized
            as fellow laborers in the gospel field? They were! Paul says in his
            epistle to the Philippians, "help those <em>women</em> who labored
            with me, in the gospel;" Phil. iv, 3.

         </p>
         <p>
            But this is not all. Roman <em>women</em> were burnt at the stake,
            <i>their</i> delicate limbs were torn joint from
            joint by the ferocious beasts of the Ampitheatre, and tossed by the wild
            bull in his fury, for the diversion of that idolatrous, warlike, and
            slaveholding people. Yes, <em>women</em> suffered
            under the ten persecutions of heathen Rome, with the most unshrinking
            constancy and fortitude; not all the entreaties of friends,
            nor the claims of new born infancy, nor the cruel threats of enemies
            could make <em>them</em> sprinkle one grain of incense upon the
            altars of Roman idols. Come now with me to the beautiful valleys of
            Piedmont. Whose blood stains the green sward, and decks the wild flowers
            with colors not their own, and smokes on the sword of persecuting France?
            It is <em>woman's</em>, as well as man's? Yes, <em>women</em> were
            accounted as sheep for the slaughter, and were cut down as the tender
            saplings of the wood.

         </p>
         <p>
            But time would fail me, to tell of all those hundreds and thousands
            of <em>women</em>, who perished in the Low countries of Holland,
            when Alva's sword of vengeance was unsheathed against the Protestants, when
            the Catholic Inquisitions of Europe became the merciless executioners
            of vindictive wrath, upon those who dared to worship God, instead
            of bowing down in unholy adoration before "my Lord God the
            <em>Pope</em>," and when England, too, burnt her Ann Ascoes at
            the stake of martyrdom. Suffice it to say, that the Church, after
            having been driven from Judea to Rome, and from Rome to Piedmont, and
            from Piedmont to England, and from England to Holland, at last stretched
            her fainting wings over the dark bosom of the Atlantic, and found on
            the shores of a great wilderness, a refuge from tyranny and
            oppression&#8212;as she thought, but <em>even here</em>, (the warm
            blush of shame mantles my cheek as I write it,) <em>even here,
               woman</em> was beaten and banished, imprisoned,
            and hung upon the gallows, a trophy to the Cross.
            And what, I would ask in conclusion, have <em>women</em> done for
            the great and glorious cause of Emancipation? Who wrote that pamphlet
            which moved the heart of Wilberforce to pray over the wrongs, and his
            tongue to plead the cause of the oppressed African? It was a
            <em>woman</em>, Elizabeth Heyrick. Who labored assiduously to keep
            the sufferings of the slave continually before the British public? They
            were <em>women</em>. And how did they do it? By their needles, paint
            brushes and pens, by speaking the truth, and petitioning Parliament for
            the abolition of slavery. And what was the effect of their labors?
            Read it in the Emancipation bill of Great Britain. Read it, in the present
            state of her West India Colonies. Read it, in the impulse which has been
            given to the cause of freedom, in the United States of America.
            Have English women then done so much for the negro, and shall
            American women do nothing? Oh no! Already are there sixty female
            Anti-Slavery Societies in operation. These are doing just what the
            English women did, telling the story of the colored man's wrongs,
            praying for his deliverance, and presenting his kneeling image constantly
            before the public eye on bags and needle-books, card-racks,
            pen-wipers, pin-cushions, &amp;c. Even the children of the north are
            inscribing on their handy work, "May the points of our needles prick
            the slaveholder's conscience." Some of the reports of these Societies
            exhibit not only considerable talent, but a deep sense of religious
            duty, and a determination to persevere through evil as well as good
            report, until every scourge, and every shackle, is buried under the
            feet of the manumitted slave.

         <p>
            The Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society of Boston was called last fall, to a
            severe trial of their faith and constancy. They were mobbed by "the
            gentlemen of property and standing," in that city at their anniversary
            meeting, and their lives were jeoparded by an infuriated crowd; but
            their conduct on that occasion did credit to our sex, and affords a full
            assurance that they will <em>never</em> abandon the cause of the slave.
            The pamphlet, Right and Wrong in Boston, issued by them in which a
            particular account is given of that "mob of broad cloth in broad day,"
            does equal credit to the head and the heart of her who wrote it. I

            wish my Southern sisters could read it; they would then understand
            that the women of the North have engaged in this work from a sense
            of <em>religious duty</em>, and that nothing will ever induce them
            to take their hands from it until it is fully accomplished. They feel
            no hostility to you, no bitterness or wrath; they rather sympathize in
            your trials and difficulties; but they well know that the first thing to
            be done to help you, is to pour in the light of truth on your minds, to
            urge you to reflect on, and pray over the subject. This is all
            <em>they</em> can do for you, <em>you</em> must work out your own
            deliverance with fear and trembling, and with the direction and blessing
            of God, <em>you can do it</em>. Northern women may labor
            to produce a correct public opinion at the North, but if Southern women sit
            down in listless indifference and criminal idleness, public opinion cannot
            be rectified and purified at the South. It is manifest to every reflecting
            mind, that slavery must be abolished; the era in which we live, and the
            light which is overspreading the whole world on this subject, clearly show
            that the time cannot be distant when it will be done. Now there are only
            two ways in which it can be effected, by moral power or physical force,
            and it is for <em>you</em> to choose which of these you prefer.
            Slavery always has, and always will produce insurrections wherever it
            exists, because it is a violation of the natural order of things, and no
            human power can much longer perpetuate it. The opposers of abolitionists
            fully believe this; one of them remarked to me not long since, there is no
            doubt there will be a most terrible overturning at the South in a few
            years, such cruelty and wrong, must be visited with Divine vengeance soon.
            Abolitionists believe, too, that this must inevitably be the case if you
            do not repent, and they are not willing to leave you to perish without
            entreating you, to save yourselves from destruction; well may they say
            with the apostle, "am I then your enemy because I tell you the truth,"
            and warn you to flee from impending judgments.

            But why, my dear friends, have I thus been endeavoring to lead you
            through the history of more than three thousand years, and to point
            you to that great cloud of witnesses who have gone before, "from
            works to rewards?" Have I been seeking to magnify the sufferings,
            and exalt the character of woman, that she "might have praise of
            men?" No! no! my object has been to arouse <em>you</em>, as the wives
            and mothers, the daughters and sisters, of the South, to a sense of
            your duty as <em>women</em>, and as Christian women, on that great
            subject, which has already shaken our country, from the St. Lawrence and
            the lakes, to the Gulf of Mexico, and from the Mississippi to the
            shores of the Atlantic; <em>and will continue mightily to shake it</em>,
            until the polluted temple of slavery fall and crumble into ruin. I would say
            unto each one of you, "what meanest thou, O sleeper! arise and call
            upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us that we perish
            not." Perceive you not that dark cloud of vengeance which hangs
            over our boasting Republic? Saw you not the lightnings of Heaven's wrath,
            in the flame which leaped from the Indian's torch to the
            roof of yonder dwelling, and lighted with its horrid glare the darkness
            of midnight? Heard you not the thunders of Divine anger, as the distant

            roar of the cannon came rolling onward, from the Texian country,
            where Protestant American Rebels are fighting with Mexican
            Republicans&#8212;for what? For the re-establishment of
            <em>slavery</em>; yes! of American slavery in the bosom of a Catholic
            Republic, where that system of robbery, violence, and wrong, had been
            legally abolished for twelve years. Yes! citizens of the United States,
            after plundering Mexico of her land, are now engaged in deadly conflict,
            for the privilege of fastening chains, and collars, and manacles&#8212;upon
            whom? upon the subjects of some foreign prince? No! upon native born
            American Republican citizens, although the fathers of these very men
            declared to the whole world, while struggling to free themselves from
            the three penny taxes of an English king, that they believed it to be
            a <em>self-evident</em> truth that <em>all men</em> were created
            equal, and had an <i>unalienable right to liberty</i>.

            Can you not, my friends, understand the signs of the times; do you
            not see the sword of retributive justice hanging over the South, or
            are you still slumbering at your posts?&#8212;Are there no Shiphrahs, no
            Puahs among you, who will dare in Christian firmness and Christian
            meekness, to refuse to obey the <em>wicked laws</em> which require
            <em>woman to enslave, to degrade and to brutalize woman</em>? Are there
            no Miriams, who would rejoice to lead out the captive daughters of the
            Southern States to liberty and light? Are there no Huldahs there who will
            dare to <em>speak the truth</em> concerning the sins of the people and
            those judgments, which it requires no prophet's eye to see, must follow if
            repentance is not speedily sought? Is there no Esther among you
            who will plead for the poor devoted slave? Read the history of this
            Persian queen, it is full of instruction; she at first refused to plead
            for the Jews; but, hear the words of Mordecai, "Think not within
            thyself, that <em>thou</em> shalt escape in the king's house more
            than all the Jews, for <em>if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this
               time</em>, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews
            from another place: but <em>thou and thy father's house shall be
               destroyed</em>." Listen, too, to her magnanimous reply to this powerful
            appeal; "<em>I will</em> go in unto the king, which is
            <em>not</em> according to law, and if I perish, I perish."
            Yes! if there were but <em>one</em> Esther at the South, she
            <em>might</em> save her country from ruin; but let the Christian women
            there arise, as the Christian women of Great Britain did, in the majesty
            of moral power, and that salvation is certain. Let them embody themselves
            in societies, and send petitions up to their different legislatures,
            entreating their husbands, fathers, brothers and sons, to abolish the
            institution of slavery; no longer to subject <em>woman</em> to the
            scourge and the chain, to mental darkness and moral degradation; no longer
            to tear husbands from their wives, and children from their parents; no
            longer to make men, women, and children, work <em>without wages</em>;
            no longer to make their lives bitter in hard bondage; no longer to
            reduce <em>American citizens</em>
            to the abject condition of <em>slaves</em>, of "chattels personal;" no
            longer to barter the <em>image of God</em> in human shambles for
            corruptible things such as silver and gold.

            The <em>women of the South can overthrow</em> this horrible system
            of oppression and cruelty, licentiousness and wrong. Such appeals to
            your legislatures would be irresistible, for there is something in the
            heart of man which <em>will bend under moral suasion</em>. There is a
            swift witness for truth in his bosom, which <em>will respond to
               truth</em> when it is uttered with calmness and dignity. If you could
            obtain but six signatures to such a petition in only one state, I would
            say, send up that petition, and be not in the least discouraged by the
            scoffs and jeers of the heartless, or the resolution of the house to lay
            it on the table. It will be a great thing if the subject can be
            introduced into your legislatures in any way, even by <em>women</em>,
            and <em>they</em> will be the most likely to introduce it there in
            the best possible manner, as a matter of <em>morals</em> and
            <em>religion</em>, not of expediency or politics. You may
            petition, too, the different ecclesiastical bodies of the slave states.
            Slavery must be attacked with the whole power of truth and the
            sword of the spirit. You must take it up on <em>Christian</em> ground,
            and fight against it with Christian weapons, whilst your feet are shod with
            the preparation of the gospel of peace. And <em>you are now</em> loudly
            called upon by the cries of the widow and the orphan, to arise and
            gird yourselves for this great moral conflict "with the whole armour
            of righteousness on the right hand and on the left."

         <p>
            There is every encouragement for you to labor and pray, my
            friends, because the abolition of slavery as well as its existence, has
            been the theme of prophecy. "Ethiopia (says the Psalmist) shall
            stretch forth her hands unto God." And is she not now doing so?
            Are not the Christian negroes of the south lifting their hands in prayer
            for deliverance, just as the Israelites did when their redemption was
            drawing nigh? Are they not sighing and crying by reason of the
            hard bondage? And think you, that He, of whom it was said, "and
            God heard their groaning, and their cry came up unto him by reason
            of the hard bondage," think you that his ear is heavy that he cannot
            <em>now</em> hear the cries of his suffering children? Or that He who
            raised up a Moses, an Aaron, and a Miriam, to bring them up out of the
            land of Egypt from the house of bondage, cannot now, with a high
            hand and a stretched out arm, rid the poor negroes out of the hands
            of their masters? Surely you believe that his arm is <em>not</em>
            shortened that he cannot save. And would not such a work of mercy redound
            to his glory? But another string of the harp of prophecy vibrates to
            the song of deliverance: "But they shall sit every man under his
            vine, and under his fig-tree, and <em>none shall make them afraid</em>;
            for the mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken it." The <em>slave</em>
            never can do this as long as he is a <em>slave</em>; whilst he is a
            "chattel personal" he can own <em>no</em> property; but the time
            <em>is to come</em> when <em>every</em> man is to sit under
            <em>his own</em> vine and <em>his own</em> fig-tree, and no
            domineering driver, or irresponsible master, or irascible mistress,
            shall make him afraid of the chain or the whip. Hear, too, the sweet
            tones of another

            string: "Many shall run to and fro, and <em>knowledge</em> shall be
            increased." Slavery is an insurmountable barrier to the increase of
            knowledge in every community where it exists; <em>slavery, then, must be
               abolished before</em> this prediction can be fulfilled. The last chord
            I shall touch, will be this, "They shall <em>not</em> hurt nor destroy
            in all my holy mountain."

         </p>
         <p><em>Slavery, then, must be overthrown before</em> the prophecies can
            be accomplished, but how are they to be fulfilled? Will the wheels of the
            millennial car be rolled onward by miraculous power? No! God
            designs to confer this holy privilege upon <em>woman</em>; it is
            through <em>their</em> instrumentality
            that the great and glorious work of reforming the world
            is to be done. And see you not how the mighty engine of
            <em>moral power</em>
            is dragging in its rear the Bible and peace societies, anti-slavery
            and temperance, sabbath schools, moral reform, and missions?
            or to adopt another figure, do not these seven philanthropic associations
            compose the beautiful tints in that bow of promise which spans
            the arch of our moral heaven? Who does not believe, that if these
            societies were broken up, their constitutions burnt, and the vast
            machinery with which they are laboring to regenerate mankind was
            stopped, that the black clouds of vengeance would soon, burst over
            our world, and every city would witness the fate of the devoted cities
            of the plain? Each one of these societies is walking abroad through
            the earth scattering the seeds of truth over the wide field of our
            world, not with the hundred hands of a Briareus, but with a hundred
            thousand.

         </p>
         <p>
            Another encouragement for you to labor, my friends, is, that you
            will have the prayers and co-operation of English and Northern
            philanthropists. You will never bend your knees in supplication at the
            throne of grace for the overthrow of slavery, without meeting there
            the spirits of other Christians, who will mingle their voices with yours,
            as the morning or evening sacrifice ascends to God. Yes, the spirit
            of prayer and of supplication has been poured out upon many, many
            hearts; there are wrestling Jacobs who will not let go of the prophetic
            promises of deliverance for the captive, and the opening, of prison doors
            to them that are bound. There are Pauls who are saying, in reference
            to this subject, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" There are
            Marys sitting in the house now, who are ready to arise and go forth
            in this work as soon as the message is brought, "the master is come
            and calleth for thee." And there are Marthas, too, who have already
            gone out to meet Jesus, as he bends his footsteps to their brother's
            grave, and weeps, <em>not</em> over the lifeless body of Lazarus
            bound hand and foot in grave-clothes, but over the politically and
            intellectually lifeless slave, bound hand and foot in the iron chains
            of oppression and
            ignorance. Some may be ready to say, as Martha did, who seemed
            to expect nothing but sympathy from Jesus, "Lord, by this time he
            stinketh, for he hath been dead four days." She thought it useless
            to remove the stone and expose the loathsome body of her brother;
            she could not believe that so great a miracle could be wrought, as to
            raise <em>that putrified body</em> into life; but "Jesus said, take
            <em>ye</em> away the

            stone;" and when <em>they</em> had taken away the stone where the dead
            was laid, and uncovered the body of Lazarus, then it was that "Jesus
            lifted up his eyes and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard
            me," &amp;c. "And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
            Lazarus, come forth." Yes, some may be ready to say of the
            colored race, how can <em>they</em> ever be raised politically and
            intellectually, they have been dead four hundred years? But <em>we</em>
            have <em>nothing</em> to do with <em>how</em> this is to be done;
            <em>our business</em> is to take away the
            stone which has covered up the dead body of our brother, to expose
            the putrid carcass, to show <em>how</em> that body has been bound with
            the grave-clothes of heathen ignorance, and his face with the napkin of
            prejudice, and having done all it was our duty to do, to stand by
            the negro's grave, in humble faith and holy hope, waiting to hear
            the life-giving command of "Lazarus, come forth." This is just
            what Anti-Slavery Societies are doing; they are taking away the
            stone from the mouth of the tomb of slavery, where lies the putrid
            carcass of our brother. They want the pure light of heaven to shine
            into that dark and gloomy cave; they want all men to see <em>how</em>
            that dead body has been bound, <em>how</em> that face has been wrapped
            in the <em>napkin of prejudice</em>; and shall they wait beside that
            grave in vain? Is not Jesus still the resurrection and the life? Did He
            come to proclaim liberty to the captive, and the opening of prison doors
            to them that are bound, in vain? Did He promise to give beauty for ashes,
            the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit
            of heaviness unto them that mourn in Zion, and will He refuse to
            beautify the mind, anoint the head, and throw around the captive
            negro the mantle of praise for that spirit of heaviness which has so
            long bowed him down to the ground? Or shall we not rather say
            with the prophet, "the zeal of the Lord of Hosts <em>will</em> perform
            this?" Yes, his promises are sure, and amen in Christ Jesus, that he will
            assemble her that halteth, and gather her that is driven out, and her
            that is afflicted.

         </p>
         <p>
            But I will now say a few words on the subject of Abolitionism.
            Doubtless you have all heard Anti-Slavery Societies denounced as
            insurrectionary and mischievous, fanatical and dangerous. It has
            been said they publish the most abominable untruths, and that they
            are endeavoring to excite rebellions at the South. Have you believed
            these reports, my friends? have <em>you</em> also been deceived by these false
            assertions? Listen to me, then, whilst I endeavor to wipe from the
            fair character of Abolitionism such unfounded accusations. You
            know that <em>I</em> am a Southerner: your know that my dearest
            relatives are now in a slave State. Can you for a moment believe I
            would prove so recreant to the feelings of a daughter and a sister,
            as to join a society which seeking to overthrow slavery by falsehood,
            bloodshed and murder? I appeal to you who have known and loved me
            in days that are passed, can <em>you</em> believe it? No! my
            friends. As a Carolinian, I was peculiarly jealous of any movements
            on this subject; and before I would join an Anti-Slavery Society, I
            took the precaution

            of becoming acquainted with some of the leading Abolitionists,
            of reading their publications and attending their meetings, at which I
            heard addresses both from colored and white men; and it was not
            until I was fully convinced that their principles were <em>entirely
               pacific,</em> and their efforts <em>only moral,</em> that I
            gave my name as a member to the Female Anti-Slavery Society of
            Philadelphia. Since that time, I have regularly taken the Liberator,
            and read many Anti-Slavery pamphlets and papers and books, and can
            assure you I <em>never</em> have seen a single
            insurrectionary paragraph, and never read any account of cruelty
            which I could not believe. Southerners may deny the truth of these
            accounts, but why do they not <em>prove</em> them to be false.
            Their violent expressions of horror at such accounts being
            believed, <em>may</em> deceive some, but they cannot deceive
            <em>me,</em> for I lived too long in the midst of
            slavery, not to know what slavery is. Such declarations remind me
            of an assertion made by a Catholic priest, who said that his Church
            had never persecuted Protestants for their religion, when it is well
            known that the pages of history are black with the crimes of the
            Inquisition. Oh! if the slaves of the South could only write a book,
            it would vie, I have no doubt, with the horrible details of Catholic
            cruelty. When <em>I</em> speak of this system, "I speak that I
            do know," and I am not afraid to assert, that Anti-Slavery
            publications have <em>not</em> overdrawn the monstrous features of
            slavery at all. And many a Southerner <em>knows</em> this as well
            as I do. A lady in North Carolina remarked to a friend of mine, about
            eighteen months since, "Northerners know nothing at all about slavery;
            they think it is perpetual bondage only; but of the <em>depth of
               degradation</em> that word involves, they have no conception;
            if they had, <em>they would never cease</em> their efforts until
            so <em>horrible</em> a system was overthrown." She did not, know
            how faithfully some Northern men and Northern women had studied this
            subject; how diligently they had searched out the cause of "him who
            had none to help him," and how fearlessly they had told the story of
            the negro's wrongs. Yes, Northerners know <em>every</em> thing
            about slavery now. This monster of iniquity has been unveiled to the
            world, his frightful features unmasked, and soon, very soon, will he be
            regarded with no more complacency by the American republic than is
            the idol of Juggernaut, rolling its bloody wheels over the crushed
            bodies of its prostrate victims.

         </p>
         <p>
            But you will probably ask, if Anti-Slavery societies are not
            insurrectionary, why do Northerners tell us they are! Why, I would ask
            you in return, did Northern senators and Northern representatives
            give their votes, at the last sitting of congress, to the admission of
            Arkansas Territory as a slave state? Take those men, one by one, and
            ask them in their parlours, do you <em>approve of slavery?</em>
            ask them on <em>Northern</em> ground, where they will speak the
            truth, and I doubt not <em>every man</em> of them will tell you,
            <em>no</em>! Why then, I ask, did <em>they</em> give
            their votes to enlarge the mouth of that grave which has already
            destroyed its tens of thousands! All our enemies tell <em>us</em>
            they are as much anti slavery as we are. Yes, my friends, thousands
            who are helping you to bind the fetters of slavery on the negro,
            despise you in their hearts for doing it; they rejoice that such an
            institution has not been entailed upon them. Why then, I would ask,
            do <em>they</em> lend you their help? I will tell you, "they love
            <em>the praise of men more</em> than the praise of God." The
            Abolition cause has not yet become so popular as to induce them to
            believe, that by advocating it in congress, they shall sit still more
            securely in their seats there, and like

            the <em>chief rulers</em> in the days of our Saviour, though
            <em>many</em> believed on him, yet they did <em>not</em>
            confess him, lest they should <em>be put out of the
               synagogue</em>; John xii, 42, 43. Or perhaps like Pilate, thinking
            they could prevail nothing, and fearing a tumult, they determined to
            release Barabbas and surrender the just man, the poor innocent slave
            to be stripped of his rights and scourged. In vain will such men try
            to wash their hands, and say, with the Roman governor, "I am innocent
            of the blood of this just person." Northern American statesmen
            are no more innocent of the crime of slavery, than Pilate was of the
            murder of Jesus, or Saul of that of Stephen. These are high charges,
            but I appeal to <em>their hearts</em>; I appeal to public opinion
            ten years from now. Slavery then is a national sin.

         </p>
         <p>
            But you will say, a great many other Northerners tell us so, who
            can have no political motives. The interests of the North, you must
            know, my friends, are very closely combined with those of the South.
            The Northern merchants and manufacturers are making
            <em>their</em> fortunes out of the <em>produce of slave
               labor</em>; the grocer is selling your rice and
            sugar; how then can these men bear a testimony against slavery
            without condemning themselves? But there is another reason, the
            North is most dreadfully afraid of Amalgamation. She is alarmed
            at the very idea of a thing so monstrous, as she thinks. And lest
            this consequence <em>might</em> flow from emancipation, she is
            determined to resist all efforts at emancipation without expatriation.
            It is not because she <em>approves of slavery</em>, or believes
            it to be "the corner stone of our republic," for she is as much
            <em>anti-slavery</em> as we are; but amalgamation is too horrible
            to think of. Now I would ask <em>you</em>, is it right, is it
            generous, to refuse the colored people in this country the advantages
            of education and the privilege, or rather the <em>right</em>, to
            follow honest trades and callings merely because they are colored?
            The same prejudice exists here against our colored brethren that
            existed against the Gentiles in Judea. Great numbers cannot bear
            the idea of equality, and fearing lest, if they had the same
            advantages we enjoy, they would become as intelligent, as moral, as
            religious, and as respectable and wealthy, they are determined to
            keep them as low as they possibly can. Is this doing as they would
            be done by? Is this loving their neighbor as <em>themselves</em>?
            Oh! that <em>such</em> opposers of Abolitionism would put their
            souls in the stead of the free colored man's and obey the apostolic
            injunction, to "remember them that are in bonds <em>as bound with
               them</em>." I will leave you to judge whether the fear of
            amalgamation ought to induce men to oppose anti-slavery efforts,
            when <em>they</em> believe <em>slavery</em> to be
            <em>sinful</em>. Prejudice against color, is the most powerful
            enemy we have to fight with at the North.

         </p>
         <p>
            You need not be surprised, then, at all, at what is said
            <em>against</em> Abolitionists by the North, for they are wielding
            a two-edged sword, which even here, cuts through the <em>cords of
               caste</em>, on the one side, and the <em>bonds of interest</em>
            on the other. They are only sharing the fate of other reformers,
            abused and reviled whilst they are in the minority; but they are
            neither angry nor discouraged by the invective which has been heaped
            upon them by slaveholders at the South and

            their apologists at the North. They know that when George Fox
            and William Edmundson were laboring in behalf of the negroes in
            the West Indies in 1671 that the very <em>same</em> slanders were
            propogated against them, which are <em>now</em> circulated against
            Abolitionists. Although it was well known that Fox was the founder of
            a religious sect which repudiated <em>all</em> war, and
            <em>all</em> violence, yet <em>even he</em> was
            accused of "endeavoring to excite the slaves to insurrection and of
            teaching the negroes to cut their master's throats." And these two
            men who had their feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of
            Peace, were actually compelled to draw up a formal declaration that
            <em>they were not</em> trying to raise a rebellion in Barbadoes.
            It is also worthy of remark that these Reformers did not at this time
            see the necessity of emancipation under seven years, and their
            principal efforts were exerted to persuade the planters of the
            necessity of instructing their slaves; but the slaveholder saw then,
            just what the slaveholder sees now, that an <em>enlightened</em>
            population <em>never</em> can be a <em>slave</em> population,
            and therefore they passed a law that negroes should
            not even attend the meetings of Friends. Abolitionists know that the
            life of Clarkson was sought by slavetraders, and that even Wilberforce
            was denounced on the floor of Parliament as a fanatic and a
            hypocrite by the present King of England, the very man who, in 1834
            set his seal to that instrument which burst the fetters of eight
            hundred thousand slaves in his West India colonies. They know that
            the first Quaker who bore a <em>faithful</em> testimony against
            the sin of slavery was cut off from religious fellowship with that
            society. That Quaker was a <em>woman</em>. On her deathbed she
            sent for the committee who dealt with her&#8212;she told them, the near
            approach of death had not altered her sentiments on the subject of
            slavery and waving her hand towards a very fertile and beautiful
            portion of country which lay stretched before her window, she said
            with great solemnity, "Friends, the time will come when there will not
            be friends enough in all this district to hold one meeting for
            worship, and this garden will be turned into a wilderness."

         </p>
         <p>
            The aged friend, who with tears in his eyes, related this interesting
            circumstance to me, remarked, that at that time there were seven
            meetings of friends in that part of Virginia, but that when he was
            there ten years ago, not a single meeting was held, and the country
            was literally a desolation. Soon after her decease, John Woolman
            began his labors in our society, and instead of disowning a member
            for testifying <em>against</em> slavery, they have for sixty-two
            years positively forbidden their members to hold slaves.

         </p>

            Abolitionists understand the slaveholding spirit too well to be
            surprised at any thing that has yet happened at the South or the
            North; they know that the greater the sin is, which is exposed, the
            more violent will be the efforts to blacken the character and impugn
            the motives of those who are engaged in bringing to light the hidden
            things of darkness. They understand the work of Reform too well to be
            driven back by the furious waves of opposition, which are only foaming
            out their own shame. They have stood "the world's dread

            laugh," when only twelve men formed the first Anti-Slavery Society
            in Boston in 1831. They have faced and refuted the calumnies of
            their enemies, and proved themselves to be emphatically
            <em>peace men</em> by <em>never resisting</em> the violence of
            mobs, even when driven by them from the temple of God, and dragged by
            an infuriated crowd through the streets of the emporium of
            New-England, or subjected by <em>slaveholders</em>
            to the pain of corporal punishment. "None of these things move
            them;" and, by the grace of God, they are determined to persevere
            in this work of faith and labor of love: they mean to pray, and
            preach, and write, and print, until slavery is completely overthrown,
            until Babylon is taken up and cast into the sea, to "be found no
            more at all." They mean to petition Congress year after year, until
            the seat of our government is cleansed from the sinful traffic of
            "slaves and the souls of men." Although that august assembly may
            be like the unjust judge who "feared not God neither regarded man,"
            yet it <em>must</em> yield just as he did, from the power of
            importunity. Like the unjust judge, Congress <em>must</em> redress
            the wrongs of the widow, lest by the continual coming up of petitions,
            it be wearied. This will be striking the dagger into the very heart of
            the monster, and once this done, he must soon expire.

         </p>
         <p>
            Abolitionists have been accused of abusing their Southern brethren.
            Did the prophet Isaiah <em>abuse</em> the Jews when he addressed
            to them the cutting reproof contained in the first chapter of his
            prophecies, and ended by telling them, they would be
            <em>ashamed</em> of the oaks they had desired, and
            <em>confounded</em> for the garden they had chosen? Did John the
            Baptist <em>abuse</em> the Jews when he called them "<em>a
               generation of vipers</em>," and warned them "to bring forth fruits
            meet for repentance!" Did Peter abuse the Jews when he told them they
            were the murderers of the Lord of Glory? Did Paul abuse the Roman
            Governor when he reasoned before him of righteousness, temperance,
            and judgment, so as to send conviction home to his guilty heart, and
            cause him to tremble in view of the crimes he was living in? Surely
            not. No man will <em>now</em> accuse the prophets and apostles of
            <em>abuse</em>, but what have Abolitionists done more than they?
            No doubt the Jews thought the prophets and apostles in their day, just
            as harsh and uncharitable as slaveholders now, think Abolitionists; if
            they did not, why did they beat, and stone, and kill them?

            Great fault has been found with the prints which have been employed
            to expose slavery at the North, but my friends, how could this
            be done so effectively in any other way? Until the pictures of the
            slave's sufferings were drawn and held up to public gaze, no
            Northerner had any idea of the cruelty of the system, it never
            entered their minds that such abominations could exist in Christian,
            Republican America; they never suspected that many of the
            <em>gentlemen</em> and <em>ladies</em> who came from the South
            to spend the summer months in traveling among them, were petty tyrants
            at home. And those who had lived at the South, and came to reside at
            the North, were too <em>ashamed of slavery</em> even to speak of
            it; the language of their hearts was, "tell it <em>not</em> in
            Gath, publish it <em>not</em> in the streets of Askelon;" they
            saw no

            use in uncovering the loathsome body to popular sight, and in hopeless
            despair, wept in secret places over the sins of oppression. To
            such hidden mourners the formation of Anti-Slavery Societies was
            as life from the dead, the first beams of hope which gleamed through
            the dark clouds of despondency and grief. Prints were made use
            of to effect the abolition of the Inquisition in Spain, and Clarkson
            employed them when he was laboring to break up the Slave trade,
            and English Abolitionists used them just as we are now doing.
            They are powerful appeals and have invariably done the work they
            were designed to do, and we cannot consent to abandon the use of
            these until the <em>realities</em> no longer exist.

         </p>
         <p>
            With regard to those white men, who, it was said, did try to raise
            an insurrection in Mississippi a year ago, and who were stated to be
            Abolitionists, none of them were proved to be members of Anti-Slavery
            Societies, and it must remain a matter of great doubt whether,
            even they were guilty of the crimes alledged against them, because
            when any community is thrown into such a panic as to inflict Lynch
            law upon accused persons, they cannot be supposed to be capable of
            judging with calmness and impartiality. <em>We know</em> that the
            papers of which the Charleston mail was robbed, were <em>not</em>
            insurrectionary, and that they were <em>not</em> sent to the
            colored people as was reported. <em>We know</em> that Amos Dresser
            was <em>no insurrectionist</em> though he was accused of being so,
            and on this false accusation was publicly whipped in Nashville in the
            midst of a crowd of infuriated <em>slaveholders</em>. Was
            that young man disgraced by this infliction of corporal punishment?
            No more than was the great apostle of the Gentile; who five times
            received forty stripes, save one. Like him, he might have said,
            "henceforth I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus," for
            it was for the <em>truth's sake, he suffered</em>, as much as did
            the Apostle Paul. Are Nelson, and Garrett, and Williams, and other
            Abolitionists who have recently been banished from Missouri,
            insurrectionists? <em>We know</em> they are <em>not</em>,
            whatever slaveholders may choose to call them. The spirit which now
            asperses the character of the Abolitionists, is the <em>very
               same</em> which dressed up the Christians of Spain in the skins of
            wild beasts and pictures of devils when they were led to execution as
            heretics. Before we condemn individuals, it is necessary, even in a
            wicked community, to accuse them of some crime; hence, when Jezebel
            wished to compass the death of Naboth, men of Belial were suborned
            to bear false witness against him, and so it was with Stephen, and so
            it ever has been, and ever will be, as long as there is any virtue to
            suffer on the rack, or the gallows. <em>False</em> witnesses must
            appear against Abolitionists before they can be condemned.

         </p>
         <p>
            I will now say a few words on George Thompson's mission to this
            country. This Philanthropist was accused of being a foreign emissary.
            Were Lafayette, and Steuben, and De Kalb, and Pulawski,
            foreign emissaries when they came over to America to fight against
            the tories, who preferred submitting to what was termed, "the yoke
            of servitude," rather than bursting the fetters which bound them to
            the mother country? <em>They</em> came with <em>carnal
               weapons</em> to engage in <em>bloody</em>
            conflict against American citizens, and yet, where do their names
            stand on the page of History. Among the honorable, or the base?
            Thompson came here to war against the giant sin of slavery,
            <em>not</em> with the sword and the pistol, but with the smooth
            stones of oratory taken from the pure waters of the river of Truth.
            His splendid talents and commanding eloquence rendered him a powerful
            coadjutor in the Anti-Slavery cause, and in order to neutralize the
            effects of these upon his auditors, and rob the poor slave of the
            benefits of his labors, his character was defamed, his life was
            sought, and he at last driven from our Republic, as a fugitive. But
            was <em>Thompson</em> disgraced by all this mean and contemptible
            and wicked chicanery and malice? No more than was Paul, when in
            consequence of a vision he had seen at Treas, he went over the
            Macedonia to help the Christians there, and was beaten and
            imprisoned, because he cast out a spirit of divination
            from a young damsel which had brought much gain to her masters.
            Paul was as much a <em>foreign emissary</em> in the Roman colony
            of Philippi, as George Thompson was in America, and it was because he
            was a <em>Jew</em>, and taught customs it was not lawful for them
            to receive or observe being Romans, that the Apostle was thus treated.

         </p>
         <p>
            It was said, Thompson was a felon, who had fled to this country to
            escape transportation to New Holland. Look at him now pouring
            the thundering strains of his eloquence, upon crowded audiences in
            Great Britain, and see in this a triumphant vindication of his
            character. And have the slaveholder, and his obsequious apologist,
            gained anything by all their violence and falsehood? No! for the stone
            which struck Goliath of Gath, had already been thrown from the
            sling. The giant of slavery who had so proudly defied the armies
            of the living God, had received his death-blow before he left our
            shores. But what is George Thompson doing there? Is he not now
            laboring there, as effectually to abolish American slavery as though
            he trod our own soil, and lectured to New York or Boston assemblies?
            What is he doing there, but constructing a stupendous dam,
            which will turn the overwhelming tide of public opinion over the
            wheels of that machinery which Abolitionists are working here. He
            is now lecturing to <em>Britons</em> on
            <em>American Slavery</em>, to the <em>subjects</em> of a
            <em>King</em>, on the abject condition of the <em>slaves of
               a Republic</em>. He is telling them of that mighty Confederacy of
            petty tyrants which extends over thirteen States of our Union. He is
            telling them of the munificent rewards offered by slaveholders, for
            the heads of the most distinguished advocates for freedom in this
            country. He is moving the British Churches to send out to the churches
            of America the most solemn appeals, reproving, rebuking, and
            exhorting, them with all
            long suffering and patience to abandon the sin of slavery immediately.
            Where then I ask, will the name of George Thompson stand on the
            page of History? Among the honorable, or the base?

         </p>
         <p>
            What can I say more, my friends, to induce you to set your hands,
            and heads, and hearts, to the great work of justice and mercy. Perhaps
            you have feared the consequences of immediate emancipation,
            and been frightened by all those dreadful prophecies of rebellion,

            bloodshed and murder, which have been uttered. "Let no man deceive
            you;" they are the predictions of that same "lying spirit" which
            spoke through the four hundred prophets of old, to Ahab king of
            Israel, urging him on to destruction. <em>Slavery</em> may produce
            these horrible scenes if it is continued five years longer, but
            Emancipation <em>never will</em>.

         </p>
         <p>
            I can prove the <em>safety</em> of immediate Emancipation by
            history. In St. Domingo in 1793 six hundred thousand slaves were set
            free in a white population of forty-two thousand. That Island "marched
            as by enchantment towards its ancient splendor", cultivation prospered,
            every day produced perceptible proofs of its progress, and the
            negroes all continued quietly to work on the different plantations,
            until in 1802, France determined to reduce these liberated slaves
            again to bondage. It was at <em>this time</em> that all those
            dreadful scenes of cruelty occurred, which we so often
            <em>unjustly</em> hear spoken of, as the effects of Abolition.
            They were occasioned <em>not</em> by Emancipation, but by the
            base attempt to fasten the chains of slavery on the limbs
            of liberated slaves.

         </p>
         <p>
            In Guadaloupe eighty-five thousand slaves were freed in a white
            population of thirteen thousand. The same prosperous effects followed
            manumission here, that had attended it in Hayti, every thing
            was quiet until Buonaparte sent out a fleet to reduce these negroes
            again to slavery, and in 1802 this institution was re-established in
            that Island. In 1834, when Great Britain determined to liberate the
            slaves in her West India colonies, and proposed the apprenticeship
            system; the planters of Bermuda and Antigua, after having joined
            the other planters in their representations of the bloody consequences
            of Emancipation, in order if possible to hold back the hand which
            was offering the boon of freedom to the poor negro; as soon as they
            found such falsehoods were utterly disregarded, and Abolition must
            take place, came forward voluntarily, and asked for the compensation
            which was due to them, saying, <em>they preferred immediate
               emancipation</em>, and were not afraid of any insurrection. And
            how is it with these islands now? They are decidedly more prosperous
            than any of those on which the apprenticeship system was adopted, and
            England is now trying to abolish that system, so fully convinced is
            she that immediate Emancipation is the <em>safest</em> and the
            best plan.

         </p>
         <p>
            And why not try it in the Southern States, if it <em>never</em>
            has occasioned rebellion; if <em>not a drop of blood</em> has ever
            been shed in consequence
            of it, though it has been so often tried, why should we suppose it
            would produce such disastrous consequences now? "Be not deceived
            then, God is not mocked," by such false excuses for not doing
            justly and loving mercy. There is nothing to fear from immediate
            Emancipation, but <em>every thing</em> from the continuance of
            slavery.

         </p>
         <p>
            Sisters in Christ, I have done. As a Southerner, I have felt it was
            my duty to address you. I have endeavoured to set before you the
            exceeding sinfulness of slavery, and to point you to the example of
            those noble women who have been raised up in the church to effect
            great revolutions, and to suffer for the truth's sake. I have appealed

            to your sympathies as women, to your sense of duty as
            <em>Christian women</em>. I have attempted to vindicate the
            Abolitionists, to prove the entire safety of immediate Emancipation,
            and to plead the cause of the poor and oppressed. I have done&#8212;I have
            sowed the seeds of truth, but I well know, that even if an Apollos
            were to follow in my steps to water them, "<em>God only</em> can
            give the increase." To Him then who is able to prosper the work of
            his servant's hand, I commend this Appeal in fervent prayer, that as
            he "hath <em>chosen the weak things of the world</em>, to
            confound the things which are mighty," so He may guise His blessing,
            to descend and carry conviction to the hearts of many Lydias through
            these speaking pages. Farewell&#8212;Count me not your "enemy because I
            have told you the truth," but believe me in unfeigned affection,
            <br><br></p>

            Rev. JAMES SMYLIE,

         </p>
         <p><em>Late Stated Clerk of the Presbytery of Mississippi:</em></p>
         <p>
            SIR,&#8212;Accept my thanks for your politeness in sending me a copy
            of your book on slavery. This book proves, that the often repeated
            assertion, that the whole South is opposed to the discussion of the
            question of slavery, is not true:&#8212;and so far, I rejoice in its
            appearance. I presume&#8212;I know, indeed, that you are not the only man
            in the South, who is in favor of this discussion. There are,
            doubtless, many persons in the South, who believe, that all attempts
            to suppress it, are vain, as well as wicked. Besides, you virtually
            admit, that the South is compelled to discuss the question of
            slavery; or, at least, to give her own views of it, in order to
            prevent the conscience of Southern Christians&#8212;that conscience,
            "which does make cowards of us all"&#8212;from turning traitor to the
            cause of slavery. I rejoice, too, that you accompanied the copy sent
            to me, with the request, that I should review it, and make "candid
            remarks" upon it; and, that you have thus put it in my power to send
            to the South some of my views on slavery, without laying myself open
            to the charge of being discourteous and obtrusive.

         </p>
         <p>
            You undertake to show that slavery existed, and, with the Divine
            approbation, amongst the Old Testament Jews; and that it also
            existed, whilst our Saviour and his Apostles were on the earth, and
            was approved by them. You thence argue, that it is not only an
            innocent institution, but one which it is a religious duty to
            maintain.

         </p>
         <p>
            I admit, for the sake of argument, that there was a servitude in the
            patriarchal families which was approved by God. But what does this
            avail in your defence of slavery, unless you show, that that servitude
            and slavery are essentially alike? The literal terms of the relation
            of master and servant, under that servitude, are not made known to
            us; but we can, nevertheless, confidently infer their spirit from
            facts,

            which illustrate their practical character; and, if this character be
            found to be opposite to that of slavery, then it is manifest, that
            what you say of patriarchal servitude is impertinent, and tends to
            mislead, rather than enlighten your readers. To a few of these facts
            and a few of the considerations arising from them, I now call your
            attention.

         </p>
         <p>
            1st. Read the first eight verses of the eighteenth chapter of Genesis,
            and tell me, if you ever saw Gov. McDuffie or any other Southern
            patriarch (for the governor desires to have all slaveholders looked
            upon in the character of patriarchs) putting himself on a level with
            his servants, and "working with his hands," after the manner of
            Abraham and Sarah?

         </p>
         <p>
            2d. There was such a community of interest&#8212;so much of mutual
            confidence&#8212;between Abraham and his servants, that they fought his
            battles. Indeed, the terms of this patriarchal servitude were such,
            that in the event of the master's dying without issue, one of his
            servants inherited his property (Gen. 15: 3). But, according to the
            code of Southern slavery, the slave can no more own property, than
            he can own himself. "All that a slave possesses belongs to his
            master"&#8212;"Slaves are incapable of inheriting or transmitting
            property." These, and many similar phrases, are found in that code.
            Severe as was the system of Roman slavery, yet in this respect, it
            was far milder than yours; for its subjects could acquire property
            (their peculium); and frequently did they purchase their liberty with
            it. So far from Southern slaves being, as Abraham's servants were,
            a dependence in war, it is historically true, that they are accustomed
            to improve this occasion to effect their escape, and strengthen the
            hands of the enemy. As a further proof that Southern slavery begets
            none of that confidence between master and slave, which characterized
            the mutual intercourse of Abraham and his servants&#8212;the slave
            is prohibited, under severe penalties, from having any weapons in his
            possession, even in time of peace; and the nightly patrol, which the
            terror-stricken whites of Southern towns keep up, in peace, as well as
            in war, argues any thing, rather than the existence of such
            confidence. "For keeping or carrying a gun, or powder or shot, or a
            club, or other weapon whatsoever, offensive or defensive, a slave
            incurs, says Southern statute book, for each offence, thirty-nine
            lashes."

         </p>
         <p>
            3d. When I read your quotation from the twenty-fourth chapter of
            Genesis, made for the purpose of showing that God allowed Abraham
            to have slaves, I could not but wonder at your imprudence, in meddling
            with this chapter, which is of itself, enough to convince any
            unbiased mind, that Abraham's servants held a relation to their

            master and to society, totally different from that held by Southern
            slaves. Have you ever known a great man in your state send his
            slave into another to choose a wife for his son?&#8212;And if so, did the
            lily white damsel he selected call the sable servant "my lord?"&#8212;And
            did her family spare no pains to manifest respect for their
            distinguished guest, and promote his comfort? But this chapter, which
            you call to your aid, informs us, that Abraham's servant was honored
            with such tokens of confidence and esteem. If a Southern slave shall
            ever be employed in such a mission, he may count himself highly
            favored, if he be not taken up by the way, imprisoned, and "sold for
            his jail fees."

         </p>
         <p>
            4th. Did you ever know Southern slaves contend for their rights
            with their masters? When a Southern master reads the thirteenth
            verse of the thirty-first chapter of Job, he must think that Job was
            in the habit of letting down his dignity very low.

         </p>
         <p>
            5th. Do Southern masters accord religious privileges and impart
            religious instruction equally to their slaves and their children? Your
            laws, which visit with stripes, imprisonment, and death, the attempt
            to teach slaves to read the Bible, show but too certainly, that the
            Southern master, who should undertake to place "his children and
            his household" on the same level, in respect to their religious
            advantages, as it is probable that Abraham did (Gen. 18:19), would
            soon find himself in the midst of enemies, not to his reputation only,
            but to his life also.

         </p>
         <p>
            And now, sir, admitting that the phrase, on which you lay so much
            stress&#8212;"bought with his money"&#8212;was used in connexion with a
            form of servitude which God approved&#8212;I put it to your candor,
            whether this phrase should be allowed to weigh at all against the
            facts I have adduced and the reasonings I have employed to show the
            true nature of that servitude, and how totally unlike it is to
            slavery? Are you not bound by the principles of sound reasoning, to
            attach to it a meaning far short of what, I grant, is its natural
            import in this age, and, especially, amongst a people who, like
            ourselves, are accustomed to associate such an expression with
            slavery? Can you deny, that you are bound to adopt such a meaning of
            it, as shall harmonize with the facts, which illustrate the nature of
            the servitude in question, and with the laws and character of Him,
            whose sanction you claim for that servitude? An opposite course would
            give a preference to words over things, which common sense could not
            tolerate. Many instances might be cited to show the absurdity of the
            assumption that whatever is spoken of in the Scriptures as being
            "bought," is property. Boaz

            "purchased" his wife. Hosea "bought her (his wife) for fifteen
            pieces of silver." Jacob, to use a common expression, "took his
            wages" in wives. Joseph "bought" the Egyptians, after they had said
            to him "buy us." But, so far from their having become the property
            of Joseph or of his king, it was a part of the bargain, that they were
            to have as much land as they wanted&#8212;seed to sow it&#8212;and four-fifths
            of the crops. The possessors of such independence and such means
            of wealth are not the property of their fellow-men.

         </p>
         <p>
            I need say no more, to prove that slavery is entirely unlike the
            servitude in the patriarchal families. I pass on, now, to the period
            between the promulgation of the Divine law by Moses, and the birth
            of Christ.

         </p>
         <p>
            You argue from the fifth and sixth verses of the twenty-first chapter
            of Exodus, that God authorized the enslavement of the Jews:
            but, on the same page, on which you do so, you also show the contrary.
            It may, nevertheless, be well for me to request you to read
            and read again Leviticus 25:39-42, until your remaining doubts,
            on this point, shall all be put to flight. I am free to admit the
            probability, that under some of the forms of servitude, in which Jews
            were held, the servant was subjected to a control so extensive as to
            expose him to suffer great cruelties. These forms corresponded with
            the spirit and usages of the age, in which they existed; entirely
            unsuited, as they are, to a period and portion of the world, blessed
            with the refining and softening influences of civilization and the
            gospel. Numerous as were the statutory regulations for the treatment
            of the servant, they could not preclude the large discretion of the
            master. The apprentice, in our country, is subjected to an authority,
            equaling a parent's authority, but not always tempered in its
            exercise, with a parent's love. His condition is, therefore, not
            unfrequently marked with severity and suffering. Now, imagine what
            this condition would be, under the harsh features of a more barbarous
            age, and you will have in it, as I conjecture, no distant resemblance
            to that of some of the Jewish servants. But how different is this
            condition from that of the slave!

         </p>
         <p>
            I am reminded in this connexion, of the polished, but pernicious,
            article on slavery in a late number of the Biblical Repertory. In
            that article Professor Hodge says, that the claim of the slaveholder
            "is found to be nothing more than a transferable claim of service
            either for life, or for a term of years." Will he allow me to ask him,
            where he discovered that the pretensions of the slaveholder are all
            resolvable into this modest claim? He certainly did not discover it

            in any slave code; nor in any practical slavery. Where then? No
            where, but in that undisclosed system of servitude, which is the
            creation of his own fancy. To this system I raise no objection
            whatever. On the contrary, I am willing to admit its beauty and its
            worthiness of the mint in which it was coined. But I protest against
            his right to bestow upon it the name of another and totally different
            thing. He must not call it slavery.

         </p>
         <p>
            Suppose a poor German to be so desirous of emigrating with his
            family to America, as to agree to give his services for ten years, as
            a compensation for the passage. Suppose further, that the services
            are to be rendered to the captain of the ship in which they sail, or
            to any other person, to whom he may assign his claim. Such a bargain
            is not uncommon. Now, according to Professor Hodge, this German
            may as rightly as any of your Southern servants, be called a slave.
            He may as rightly be called <i>property</i>, as
            they may be, who, in the language
            of the South Carolina laws, "shall be deemed, held, taken,
            reputed, and adjudged in law, to be chattels personal, in the hands
            of their owners and possessors, and their executors, administrators,
            and assigns, <em>to all intents, constructions, and purposes
               whatsoever</em>."

         </p>
         <p>
            We will glance at a few points of difference in their condition.
            1st. The German is capable of making a contract, and in the case
            supposed, does make a contract; but your slave is incapable of making
            any contract. 2d. The German receives wages; the price of
            carrying himself and family being the stipulated price for his
            services, during the ten years; but your slave receives no wages.
            3d. The German, like any other hireling, and, like any apprentice in
            our country, is under the protection of law. But, there is no law to
            shield the slave from wrongs. Being a mere chattel or thing, he has
            no rights; and, therefore, he can have no wrongs to be redressed.
            Does Professor Hodge say, that there are statutes limiting and
            regulating the power of the slaveholder? I grant there are; though it
            must be remembered, that there is one way of even murdering a slave,
            which some of the slave States do not only not forbid, but impliedly
            and practically admit<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE3_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE3_FN1"></a>. The Professor should know, however, that all

            these statutes are, practically, a mere nullity. Nevertheless, they
            show the absoluteness of the power which they nominally qualify.
            This absoluteness is as distinctly implied by them, as the like was by
            the law of the Emperor Claudius, which imposed limitations upon the
            "jus vitae et necis" (the right of life and death) which Roman slavery
            put into the hand of the master. But if the Professor should be so
            imprudent as to cite us to the slave code for evidence of its merciful
            provisions, he will, in so doing, authorize us to cite him to that
            code for evidence of the <em>nature</em> of slavery. This
            authority, however, he would not like to give us; for he is unwilling
            to have slavery judged of by its own code. He insists, that it shall
            be judged of by that ideal system of slavery, which is lodged in his
            own brain, and which he can bring forth by parcels, to suit present
            occasions, as Mahomet produced the leaves of the Koran.

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE3_FN1"></a><a href="#FootE3_FN1">A</a>: The licensed murder
            referred to, is that where the slave dies under "moderate
            correction." But is not the murder of a slave by a white man,
            <em>in any way</em>, practically licensed in all the slave States?
            Who ever heard of a white man's being put to death, under Southern
            laws, for the murder of a slave? American slavery provides impunity
            for the white murderer of the slave, by its allowing none but
            whites&#8212;none but those who construct and uphold the system of
            abominations&#8212;to testify against the murderer. But why particularize
            causes of this impunity? The whole policy of the Southern slave
            system goes to provide it. How unreasonable is it to suppose, that
            they, who have conspired against a portion of their fellow-beings, and
            mutually pledged themselves to treat them as <em>mere
               things</em>&#8212;how unreasonable, I say, is it to suppose, that they
            would consent to put a <em>man</em> to death, on account of
            his treatment, in whatever way, of a <em>mere thing</em>? Not
            long ago, I was informed by a highly respectable lawyer of the State
            of Georgia, that he had known a number of attempts (attempts most
            probably but in form and name) to effect the conviction of whites
            for their undoubted murder of slaves. But in every instance, the
            jurors perjured themselves, rather than consent that a
            <em>man</em> should be put to death,
            for the liberty he had taken in disposing of a <em>thing</em>.
            They had rather perjure themselves, than by avenging the blood of a
            <em>slave</em> with that of a <em>man</em>, make a breach
            upon the policy of keeping the slave ignorant, that he has the
            <em>nature</em>, and consequently the <em>rights</em>, of
            a man.
         </p>
         <p>
            Professor Hodge tells his readers, in substance, that the selling of
            men, as they are sold under the system of slavery, is to be classed
            with the cessions of territory, occasionally made by one sovereign to
            another; and he would have the slave, who is sold from hand to
            hand, and from State to State, at the expense to his bleeding heart, of
            the disruption of its dearest ties, think his lot no harder than that of
            the inhabitant of Louisiana, who was passed without his will, from
            the jurisdiction of the French government to that of the United States.

         </p>
         <p>
            When a good man lends himself to the advocacy of slavery, he
            must, at least for a time, feel himself to be anywhere but at home,
            amongst his new thoughts, doctrines, and modes of reasoning. This
            is very evident in the case before us&#8212;especially, when now and then,
            old habits of thought and feeling break out, in spite of every effort to
            repress them, and the Professor is himself again, and discourses as
            manfully, as fearlessly, and as eloquently, as he ever had done before

            the slaveholders got their hands upon him. It is not a little amusing
            to notice, that, although the burden of his article is to show that slavery
            is one of God's institutions, (what an undertaking for a Professor of
            Theology in the year 1836!) he so far forgets the interests of his
            new friends and their expectations from him, as to admit on one page,
            that "the general principles of the gospel have destroyed domestic
            slavery throughout the greater part of Christendom;" and on another,
            that "the South has to choose between emancipation, by the silent
            and holy influence of the gospel, or to abide the issue of a long continued
            conflict against the laws of God." Whoever heard, until
            these strange times on which we have fallen, of any thing, which, to
            use the Professor's language about slavery, "it is in vain, to contend
            is sin, and yet profess reverence for the Scriptures," being at war
            with and destroyed by the principles of the gospel. What sad confusion
            of thought the pro-slavery influences, to which some great
            divines have yielded, have wrought in them!

         </p>
         <p>
            I will proceed to argue, that the institution in the Southern States
            called "slavery," is radically unlike any form of servitude under
            which Jews were held, agreeably to the Divine will; and also radically
            unlike any form of servitude approved of God in the patriarchal
            families.

         </p>
         <p>
            1st. God does not contradict Himself. He is "without variableness or shadow of turning." He loves his word and has "magnified
            it above all his name." He
            commands his rational creatures to "search the Scriptures." He cannot,
            therefore, approve of a system which forbids the searching of them, and shuts
            out their light from the soul; and which, by the confession of your own
            selves, turns men in this gospel land into heathen. He has written his
            commandment against adultery, and He cannot, therefore, approve of a system,
            which induces this crime, by forbidding marriage. The following
            extract from an opinion of the Attorney General of Maryland, shows
            some of the consequences of this "forbidding to marry." "A slave
            has never maintained an action against the violator of his bed. A
            slave is not admonished for incontinence, or punished for fornication
            or adultery; never prosecuted for bigamy." Again, God has written
            his commandment, that children should honor their parents. How,
            then, can He approve of a system, which pours contempt on the relation
            of parent and child? Which subjects them to be forcibly separated from
            each other, and that too, beyond the hope of reunion?&#8212;under which parents
            are exposed and sold in the market-place along with horses and cattle?&#8212;under
            which they are stripped and lashed,

            and made to suffer those innumerable, and some of them, nameless
            indignities, that tend to generate in their children, who witness them,
            any feelings, rather than those of respect and honor, for parents thus
            degraded? Some of these nameless indignities are alluded to in a
            letter written to me from a slave state, in March, 1833. "In this
            place," says the writer, "I find a regular and a much frequented slave
            market, where thousands are yearly sold like cattle to the highest
            bidder. It is the opinion of gentlemen here, that not far from five
            hundred thousand dollars are yearly paid in this place for negroes;
            and at this moment, I can look from the window of my room and
            count six droves of from twenty to forty each, sitting in the market
            place for sale. This morning I witnessed the sale of twelve slaves,
            and I could but shudder at the language used and the liberties taken
            with the females!"

         </p>
         <p>
            2d. As a proof, that in the kinds of servitude referred to, God did
            not invest Abraham, or any other person with that absolute ownership
            of his fellow-men, which is claimed by Southern slaveholders&#8212;I would
            remark, that He has made man accountable to Himself; but slavery
            makes him accountable to, and a mere appendage to his fellow-man.
            Slavery substitutes the will of a fallible fellow-man for that infallible
            rule of action&#8212;the will of God. The slave, instead of being allowed
            to make it the great end of his existence to glorify God and enjoy
            Him for ever, is degraded from his exalted nature, which borders upon
            angelic dignity, to be, to do, and to suffer what a mere man bids him
            be, do, and suffer.

         </p>
         <p>
            The Southern slave would obey God in respect to marriage, and also
            to the reading and studying of His word. But this, as we have seen,
            is forbidden him. He may not marry; nor may he read the Bible.
            Again, he would obey God in the duties of secret and social prayer.
            But he may not attend the prayer-meeting&#8212;certainly not that of his
            choice; and instances are known, where the master has intruded
            upon the slave's secret audience with heaven, to teach him by the
            lash, or some other instrument of torture, that he would allow "no
            other God before" himself.

         </p>
         <p>
            Said Joseph Mason, an intelligent colored man, who was born and
            bred near Richmond, in Virginia, in reply to my question whether he
            and his fellow-slaves cared about their souls&#8212;"We did not trouble
            ourselves about our souls; we were our masters' property and not
            our own; under their and not our own control; and we believed that
            our masters were responsible for our souls." This unconcern for
            their spiritual interests grew very naturally out of their relation to

            their masters; and were the relation ordained of God, the unconcern
            would, surely, be both philosophical and sinless.

         </p>
         <p>
            God cannot approve of a system of servitude, in which the master
            is guilty of assuming absolute power&#8212;of assuming God's place and
            relation towards his fellow-men. Were the master, in every case, a
            wise and good man&#8212;as wise and good as is consistent with this
            wicked and heaven-daring assumption on his part&#8212;the condition of
            the slave would it is true, be far more tolerable, than it now is. But
            even then, we should protest as strongly as ever against slavery; for
            it would still be guilty of its essential wickedness of robbing a man
            of his right to himself, and of robbing God of His right to him, and
            of putting these stolen rights into the hand of an erring mortal. Nay,
            if angels were constituted slaveholders, our objection to the relation
            would remain undiminished; since there would still be the same robbery
            of which we now complain.

         </p>
         <p>
            But you will say, that I have overlooked the servitude in which the
            Jews held strangers and foreigners; and that it is on this, more than
            any other, that you rely for your justification of slavery. I will say
            nothing now of this servitude; but before I close this communication,
            I will give my reasons for believing, that whatever was its
            nature, even if it were compulsory, it cannot be fairly pleaded in
            justification of slavery.

         </p>
         <p>
            After you shall have allowed, as you will allow, that slavery, as it
            exists, is at war with God, you will be likely to say, that the fault is
            not in the theory of it; but in the practical departure from that theory;
            that it is not the system, but the practice under it, which is at war
            with God. Our concern, however, is with slavery as it is, and not
            with any theory of it. But to indulge you, we will look at the system
            of slavery, as it is presented to us, in the laws of the slave States;
            and what do we find here? Why, that the system is as bad as the
            practice under it. Here we find the most diabolical devices to keep
            millions of human beings in a state of heathenism&#8212;in the deepest
            ignorance and most loathsome pollution. But you will tell me, that
            I do not look far enough to find the true theory of slavery; and that
            the cruelties and abominations, which the laws of the slave States have
            ingrafted on this theory, are not acknowledged by the good men in
            those States to be a part of the theory. Well, you shall have the
            benefit of this plea; and I admit, for the sake of argument, that this
            theory of slavery, which lies far back, and out of sight of every thing
            visible and known about slavery, is right. And what does this admission
            avail you? It is slavery as it is&#8212;as it is seen and known, that

            the abolitionists are contending against. But, say you, to induce our
            forbearance, "We good men at the South are restoring slavery, as
            fast as we can, to what it should be; and we will soon make its erring
            practice quadrate with its perfect and sinless theory." Success
            to your endeavors! But let me ask these good men, whether similar
            representations would avail to make them forbearing towards any
            other class of offenders; and whether they would allow these offenders
            to justify the wickedness of their hands, by pleading the purity of
            their hearts. Suppose that I stand in court confessedly guilty of the
            crime of passing counterfeit money; and that I ask for my acquittal
            on the ground, that, notwithstanding I am practically wrong, I am,
            nevertheless, theoretically right. "Believe me," I say, in tones of
            deep and unfeigned pathos, and with a corresponding pressure of my
            hand upon my heart, "that the principles within are those of the purest
            morality; and that it is my faithful endeavor to bring my deportment,
            which, as you this day witness, is occasionally devious, into perfect
            conformity with my inward rectitude. My theory of honest and holy
            living is all that you could wish it to be. Be but patient, and you
            shall witness its beautiful exhibitions in my whole conduct." Now,
            you certainly would not have this plea turn to my advantage;&#8212;why
            then expect that your similar plea should be allowed?

         </p>
         <p>
            We must continue to judge of slavery by what it is, and not by
            what you tell us it will, or may be. Until its character be righteous,
            we shall continue to condemn it; but when you shall have brought it
            back to your sinless and beautiful theory of it, it will have nothing to
            fear from the abolitionists. There are two prominent reasons, however,
            for believing that you will never present Southern slavery to us
            in this lovely character, the mere imagination of which is so dear to
            you. The first is, that you are doing nothing to this end. It is an
            indisputable fact that Southern slavery is continually getting wider and
            wider from God, and from an innocent theory of servitude; and the
            "good men at the South," of whom we have spoken, are not only
            doing nothing to arrest this increasing divergency, but they are actually
            favoring it. The writings of your Dews, and Baxters, and
            Plummers, and Postells, and Andersons, and the proceedings of your
            ecclesiastical bodies, abundantly show this. Never, and the assertion
            is borne out by your statute books, as well as other evidences, has
            Southern slavery multiplied its abominations so rapidly, as within the
            last ten years; and never before had the Southern Church been so
            much engaged to defend and perpetuate these abominations. The
            other of these reasons for believing that Southern slavery will never

            be conformed to your <i>beau ideal</i>
            of slavery, in which it is presupposed
            there are none but principles of righteousness, is, that on its first contact
            with these principles, it would "vanish into thin air," leaving
            "not a wreck behind." In proof of this, and I need not cite any other
            case, it would be immediate death to Southern slavery to concede to
            its subjects, God's institution of marriage; and hence it is, that its
            code forbids marriage. The rights of the husband in the wife, and
            of the wife in the husband, and of parents in their children, would
            stand directly in the way of that traffic in human flesh, which is the
            very life-blood of slavery; and the assumptions of the master would,
            at every turn and corner, be met and nullified by these rights; since
            all his commands to the children of those servants (for now they
            should no longer be called slaves) would be in submission to the
            paramount authority of the parents<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE3_FN2"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE3_FN2"></a>. And here, sir, you and I might
            bring our discussion to a close, by my putting the following questions
            to you, both of which your conscience would compel you to answer
            in the affirmative.

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE3_FN2"></a><a href="#FootE3_FN2">A</a>:
            I am aware that Professor Hodge asserts, that "slavery may exist without
            those laws which interfere with their (the slaves) marital or parental
            right" Now, this is a point of immense importance in the discussion of the
            question, whether slavery is sinful; and I, therefore, respectfully ask him
            either to retract the assertion, or to prove its correctness. Ten thousands
            of his fellow-citizens, to whom the assertion is utterly incredible, unite
            with me in this request. If he can show, that slavery does not "interfere
            with marital or parental rights," they will cease to oppose it. Their
            confident belief is, that slavery and marriage, whether considered in the
            light of a civil contract, or a scriptural institution, are entirely
            incompatible with each other.
         </p>
         <p>
            1st. Is not Southern slavery guilty of a most heaven-daring crime,
            in substituting concubinage for God's institution of marriage?

         </p>
         <p>
            2d. Would not that slavery, and also every theory and modification
            of slavery, for which you may contend, come speedily to nought,
            if their subjects were allowed to marry? Slavery, being an abuse, is
            incapable of reformation. It dies, not only when you aim a fatal blow
            at its life principle&#8212;its foundation doctrine of man's right to property
            in man<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE3_FN3"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE3_FN3"></a>&#8212;but it dies as surely, when you prune it of its manifold
            incidents of pollution and irreligion.

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE3_FN3"></a><a href="#FootE3_FN3">B</a>: I mean by this phrase, "right to property in
            man," a right to hold man as property; and I do not see with what propriety
            certain writers construe it to mean, a property in the mere services of a
            man.
         </p>
         <p>
            But it would be treating you indecorously to stop you at this stage
            of the discussion, before we are a third of the way through your book,
            and thus deny a hearing to the remainder of it. We will proceed to

            what you say of the slavery which existed in the time of the New
            Testament writers. Before we do so, however, let me call your attention to a
            few of the specimens of very careless reasoning in that
            part of your book, which we have now gone over. They may serve
            to inspire you with a modest distrust of the soundness of other parts
            of your argument.

         </p>
         <p>
            After concluding that Abraham was a slaveholder, you quote the
            following language from the Bible; "Abraham obeyed my voice and
            kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."
            You then inquire, "How could this be true of Abraham, holding as
            he did, until he was an old man, more slaves than any man in Mississippi or
            Louisiana?" To be consistent with your design in quoting this passage, you
            must argue from it, that Abraham was perfect. But this he was not; and,
            therefore, your quotation is vain. Again,
            if the slaveholder would quiet his conscience with the supposition,
            that "Abraham held more slaves than any man in Mississippi or
            Louisiana," let him remember, that he had also more concubines
            (Gen. 25: 6), "than any man in Mississippi or Louisiana;" and, if
            Abraham's authority be in the one case conclusive for slaveholding,
            equally so must it be in the other, for concubinage.

         </p>
         <p>
            Perhaps, in saying that "Abraham had more concubines than any
            man in Mississippi or Louisiana," I have done injustice to the spirit
            of propagation prevailing amongst the gentlemen of those States. It
            may be, that some of your planters quite distance the old patriarch in
            obedience to the command to "multiply and replenish the earth." I
            am correctly informed, that a planter in Virginia, who counted, I
            know not how many slaves upon his plantation, confessed on his
            death-bed, that his licentiousness had extended to every adult female
            amongst them. This planter was a near relative of the celebrated
            Patrick Henry. It may be, that you have planters in Mississippi and
            Louisiana, who avail themselves to the extent that he did, of the
            power which slaveholding gives to pollute and destroy. The hundreds
            of thousands of mulattoes, who constitute the Southern commentary
            on the charge, that the abolitionists design amalgamation,
            bear witness that this planter was not singular in his propensities. I
            do not know what you can do with this species of your population.
            Besides, that it is a standing and deep reproach on Southern chastity,
            it is not a little embarrassing and puzzling to those who have received
            the doctrine, that the descendants of Africa amongst us must be returned to
            the land of their ancestors. How the poor mulatto shall
            be disposed of, under this doctrine, between the call which Africa

            makes for him, on the one hand, and that which some state of Europe
            sends out for him on the other, is a problem more difficult of solution
            than that which the contending mothers brought before the matchless
            wisdom of Solomon.

         </p>
         <p>
            In the paragraph, which relates to the fourth and tenth commandments, there is
            another specimen of your loose reasoning. You say,
            that the language, "In it (the Sabbath) thou shalt do no work, thou, nor
            thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man servant, nor thy maid servant,"
            "recognises the authority of the master over the servant." I grant,
            that it does: but does it at all show, that these servants were slaves?
            Does it recognise any more authority than the master should exercise
            over his voluntary servants? Should not the head of a family
            restrain all his servants, as well the voluntary as the involuntary,
            from unnecessary labor on the Sabbath? You also say, that the tenth
            commandment "recognizes servants as the <i>property</i> of
            their masters." But how does it appear from the language of this commandment,
            that the man servant and maid servant are property any more than the
            wife is? We will proceed, however, to the third section of your
            book.

         </p>
         <p>
            Your acquaintance with history has enabled you to show some of
            the characteristics and fruits of Greek and Roman slavery. You
            state the facts, that the subjects of this slavery were "absolutely the
            property of their masters"&#8212;that they "were used like dogs"&#8212;that
            "they were forbidden to learn any liberal art or perform any act worthy
            of their masters"&#8212;that "once a day they received a certain number of
            stripes for fear they should forget they were slaves"&#8212;that, at one time,
            "sixty thousand of them in Sicily and Italy were chained and confined
            to work in dungeons"&#8212;that "in Rome there was a continual market
            for slaves," and that "the slaves were commonly exposed for sale
            naked"&#8212;that, when old, they were turned away," and that too by a
            master, highly esteemed for his superior virtues, to starve to
            death"&#8212;that they were thrown into ponds to be food for fish&#8212;that
            they were in the city of Athens near twenty times as numerous as free
            persons&#8212;that there were in the Roman Empire sixty millions of
            slaves to twenty millions of freemen mind that many of the Romans
            had five thousand, some ten thousand, and others twenty thousand.

         </p>
         <p>
            And now, for what purpose is your recital of these facts?&#8212;not,
            for its natural effect of awakening, in your readers, the utmost abhorrence
            of slavery:&#8212;no&#8212;but for the strange purpose (the more strange
            for being in the breast of a minister of the gospel) of showing your
            readers, that even Greek and Roman slavery was innocent, and

            agreeable to God's will; and that, horrid as are the fruits you describe,
            the tree, which bore them, needed but to be dug about and pruned&#8212;not
            to be cut down. This slavery is innocent, you insist, because
            the New Testament does not show, that it was specifically condemned
            by the Apostles. By the same logic, the races, the games,
            the dramatic entertainments, and the shows of gladiators, which
            abounded in Greece and Rome, were, likewise, innocent, because the
            New Testament does not show a specific condemnation of them by
            the apostles<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE3_FN4"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE3_FN4"></a>. But,
            although the New Testament does not show
            such condemnation, does it necessarily follow, that they were silent,
            in relation to these sins? Or, because the New Testament does not
            specifically condemn Greek and Roman slavery, may we, therefore,
            infer, that the Apostles did not specifically condemn it? Look
            through the published writings of many of the eminent divines, who
            have lived in modern times, and have written and published much
            for the instruction of the churches, and you will not find a line in
            them against gambling or theatres or the slave-trade;&#8212;in some of
            them, not a line against the very common sin of drunkenness. Think
            you, therefore, that they never spoke or wrote against these things?
            It would be unreasonable to expect to find, in print, their sentiments
            against all, even of the crying sins of their times. But how much
            more unreasonable is it to expect to find in the few pages of the
            Apostles' published letters, the whole of which can be read in a few
            hours, their sentiments in relation to all the prominent sins of the age
            in which they lived! And far greater still is the unreasonableness of
            setting them down, as favorable to all practices which these letters do
            not specifically condemn.

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE3_FN4"></a><a href="#FootE3_FN4">A</a>: Prof. Hodge says, if the apostles did
            abstain from declaring slavery to be sinful,
            "it must have been, because they did not consider it as, in itself, a crime.
            No other solution of their conduct is consistent with their truth or
            fidelity." But he believes that they did abstain from so doing; and he
            believes this, on the same evidence, on which he believes, that they
            abstained from declaring the races, games, &amp;c., above enumerated, to
            be sinful. His own mode of reasoning, therefore, brings him unavoidably to the
            conclusion, that these races, games, &amp;c., were not sinful.
         </p>
         <p>
            It may be, that the Saviour and the Apostles, in the course of their
            teachings, both oral and written, did specify sins to a far greater
            extent, than they are supposed to have done. It may be, that their
            followers had much instruction, in respect to the great sin of slavery.
            We must bear in mind, that but a very small part of that Divine
            instruction, which, on the testimony of an Apostle, "the world itself
            could not contain if written," has come down to us. Of the writings

            of our Saviour we have nothing. Of those of his Apostles a very
            small part. It is probable, that, during his protracted ministry, the
            learned apostle to the Gentiles wrote many letters on religious subjects
            to individuals and to churches. So also of the immense amount
            of instruction, which fell from the lips of the Apostles, but very little
            is preserved. It was Infinite Wisdom, however, which determined
            the size of the New, as well as of the Old Testament, and of what
            kinds and portions of the Saviour's and the Apostles' instructions it
            should consist. For obvious considerations, it is made up, in a great
            measure, of general truths and propositions. Its limited size, if no
            other reason, accounts for this. But, these general truths and
            propositions are as comprehensive as the necessity of the case requires;
            and, carried out into all their suitable applications they leave no sin
            unforbidden. Small as is the New Testament, it is as large as we
            need. It instructs us in relation to all our duties. It is as full on
            the subject of slavery, as is necessary; and, if we will but obey its
            directions, that bear on this subject, and "love one another," and
            love our neighbors as ourselves, and, as we would that men should
            do to us, do "also to them likewise," and "remember them, that are
            in bonds as bound with them," and "give unto servants, that which
            is just and equal"&#8212;not a vestige of this abomination will remain.

         </p>
         <p>
            For the sake of the argument, I will admit, that the Apostles made
            no specific attack on slavery<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE3_FN5"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE3_FN5"></a>; and that they left it to be reached and

            overthrown, provided it be sinful, by the general principles and
            instructions which they had inculcated. But you will say, that it was
            their practice, in addition to inculcating such principles and instructions,
            to point out sins and reprove them:&#8212;and you will ask, with
            great pertinence and force, why they did not also point out and
            reprove slavery, which, in the judgment of abolitionists, is to be classed
            with the most heinous sins. I admit, that there is no question
            addressed to abolitionists, which, after the admission I have made for
            them, it is less easy to answer; and I admit further, that they are
            bound to answer it. I will proceed to assign what to me appear to
            be some of the probable reasons, why the Apostles specified the sins
            of lying, covetousness, stealing, &amp;c., and, agreeably to the admission,
            which lays me under great disadvantage, did not specify slavery.

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE3_FN5"></a><a href="#FootE3_FN5">A</a>: This is no small
            admission in the face of the passage, in the first chapter of
            Timothy, which particularizes manstealing, as a violation of the law of
            God. I believe all scholars will admit, that one of the crimes referred to
            by the Apostle, is kidnapping. But is not kidnapping an integral and most
            vital part of the system of slavery? And is not the slaveholder guilty of
            this crime? Does he not, indeed, belong to a class of kidnappers stamped
            with peculiar meanness? The pirate, on the coast of Africa, has to cope
            with the strength and adroitness of mature years. To get his victim into
            his clutches is a deed of daring and of peril demanding no
            little praise, upon the principles of the world's "code of honor."
            But the proud chivalry of the South is securely employed in kidnapping
            newborn infants. The pirate, in the one case, soothes his conscience
            with the thought, that the bloody savages merit no better treatment,
            than they are receiving at his hands:&#8212;but the pirate, in the other, can
            have no such plea&#8212;for they, whom he kidnaps, are
            untainted with crime.


         </p>
         <p>
            And what better does it make the case for you, if we adopt the translation of
            "men stealers?" Far better, you will say, for, on the authority of Othello
            himself,

         </p>
         <div class="lg">"He that is robb'd&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br>Let him not know it, and he's not robbed at all."<br><br></div>
         <p>
            But, your authority is not conclusive. The crime of the depredation is none
            the less, because the subject is ignorant or unconscious of it. It is true,
            the slave, who never possessed liberty&#8212;who was kidnapped at his birth&#8212;may
            not grieve, under the absence of it, as he does, from whose actual and
            conscious possession it had been violently taken: but the robbery is alike
            plain, and is coupled with a meanness, in the one case, which does not
            disgrace it in the other.
         </p>
         <p>
            1st. The book of Acts sets forth the fundamental doctrines and
            requirements of Christianity. It is to the letters of the Apostles we
            are to look for extended specifications of right and wrong affections,
            and right and wrong practices. Why do these letters omit to specify
            the sin of slaveholding? Because they were addressed to professing
            Christians exclusively; who, far more emphatically then than now,
            were "the base things of the world," and were in circumstances to be
            slaves, rather than slaveholders. Doubtless, there were many slaves
            amongst them&#8212;but I cannot admit, that there were slaveholders.
            There is not the least probability, that slaveholding was a prevalent
            sin amongst primitive Christians<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE3_FN6"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE3_FN6"></a>. Instructions to them on that sin
            might have been almost as superfluous, as would be lectures on the
            sin of luxury, addressed to the poor Greenland disciples, whose
            poverty compels them to subsist on filthy oil. No one, acquainted
            with the history of their lives, believes that the Apostles were
            slave-holders. They labored, "working with (their) own hands." The

            supposition, that they were slaveholders, is inconsistent with their
            practice, and with the tenor of their instructions to others on the duty
            of manual labor. But if the Apostles were not slaveholders, why
            may we suppose, that their disciples were? At the South, it is, "like
            people, like priest," in this matter. There, the minister of the gospel
            thinks, that he has as good right to hold slaves, as has his parishioner:
            and your Methodists go so far, as to say, that even a bishop has as
            good right, as any other person, to have slaves

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE3_FN6"></a><a href="#FootE3_FN6">B</a>: How strongly does
            the following extract from the writings of the great and
            good Augustine, who lived in the fourth century, argue, that slaveholding
            was not a prevalent sin amongst primitive Christians!
            "Non opurtet Christianum possidere servum quomodo equum aut argentum.
            Quis dicere audeat ut vestimentum cum debere contemni? Hominem namque
            homo tamquam seipsum diligere debet cui ab omnium Domino, ut inimicos
            diligat, imperatur." <em>A Christian ought not to hold his
               servant as he does his horse or his money. Who dares say that he should
               be thought as lightly of as a garment? For man, whom the Lord of all has
               commanded to love his enemies, should love his fellow-man as
               himself.</em></p>
         <div class="lg">"&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;to fan him while he sleeps,<br>And tremble when he wakes."<br><br></div>
         <p>
            Indeed, they already threaten to separate from their Northern brethren,
            unless this right be conceded. But have we not other and conclusive
            evidence, that primitive Christians were not slaveholders? We
            will cite a few passages from the Bible to show, that it was not the
            will of the Apostles to have their disciples hold manual labor in
            disrepute, as it is held, in all slaveholding communities. "Do your
            own business, and work with your own hands, as we commanded
            you." "For this we commanded you, that, if any would not work,
            neither should he eat." "Let him that stole, steal no more; but
            rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good,
            that he may have to give to him that needeth." In bringing the
            whole verse into this last quotation, I may have displeased you. I
            am aware, that you slaveholders proudly and indignantly reject the
            applicableness to yourselves of the first phrase in this verse, and
            also of the maxim, that "the partaker of stolen goods is as bad as
            the thief." I am aware, that you insist, that the kidnapping of a man,
            or getting possession of him, after he has been kidnapped, is not to be
            compared, if indeed it can be properly called theft at all, with the crime
            of stealing a <i>thing</i>. It occurs to me, that if
            a shrewd lawyer had you on trial for theft, he would say, that you
            were <i>estopped</i> from going into this distinction
            between a <i>man</i> and a
            <i>thing</i>, inasmuch as, by your own
            laws, the slave is expressly declared to be a
            <i>chattel</i>&#8212;is expressly <em>elevated</em> into
            a <i>thing</i>. He would say, however competent it may
            be for others to justify themselves on the ground, that it was but a
            <i>man</i>, and not a <i>thing</i>,
            they had stolen; your own statutes, which, with
            magic celerity, convert stolen men into things, make such a plea, on
            your part, utterly inadmissible. He would have you as fast, as though
            the stolen goods, in your hands, were a bushel of wheat, or some
            other important <i>thing</i>, instead of
            <i>a mere man</i>.

         <p>
            But, if you are not yet convinced that primitive Christians were not

            slaveholders, let me cite another passage to show you, how very
            improbable it is, that they stood in this capacity:&#8212;"all, that believed,
            had all things common, and sold their possessions and goods, and
            parted them to all men, as every man had need." Now I do not say,
            that all the primitive believers did so. But if a portion of them did,
            and met with the Apostles' approbation in it, is it at all probable, that
            a course, so diverse from it, as that of slaveholding in the Church, met
            likewise with their approbation?

         </p>
         <p>
            2d. I go on to account for the Apostles' omission to specify
            slavery.

         </p>
         <p>
            Criminality is not always obvious, in proportion to its extent. The
            sin of the traffic in intoxicating liquors, was, until the last few years,
            almost universally unfelt and unperceived. But now, we meet with
            men, who, though it was "in all good conscience," that they were
            once engaged in it, would not resume it for worlds; and who see
            more criminality, in taking money from a fellow man, in exchange for
            the liquor which intoxicates him, than in simple theft. However it
            may be with others, in this employment, they now see, that, for them
            to traffic in intoxicating liquors, would be to stain themselves with the
            twofold crime of robbery and murder. How is it, that good men
            ever get into this employment?&#8212;and, under what influences and by
            what process of thought, do they come to the determination to abandon
            it? The former is accounted for, by the fact, that they grow up&#8212;have
            their education&#8212;their moral and intellectual training&#8212;in the
            midst of a public opinion, and even of laws also, which favor and sanction
            the employment. The latter is accounted for, by the fact, that
            they are brought, in the merciful providence of God, to observe and
            study and understand the consequences of their employment&#8212;especially
            on those who drink their liquor&#8212;the liquor which they sell
            or make, or, with no less criminality, furnish the materials for making.
            These consequences they find to be "evil, only evil, and that continually."
            They find, that this liquor imparts no benefit to them who
            drink it, but tends to destroy, and, oftentimes, does destroy, their
            healths and lives. To continue, therefore, in an employment in
            which they receive their neighbor's money, without returning him an
            equivalent, or any portion of an equivalent, and, in which they expose
            both his body and soul to destruction, is to make themselves, in their
            own judgments, virtually guilty of theft and murder.

         </p>
         <p>
            Thus it is in the case of a national war, waged for conquest.
            Christians have taken part in it; and, because they were blinded by
            a wrong education, and were acting in the name of their country and

            under the impulses of patriotism, they never suspected that they were
            doing the devil, instead of "God, service." But when, in the kind
            providence of God, one of these butchers of their fellow beings is
            brought to pause and consider his ways, and to resolve his enormous
            and compound sin into its elements of wickedness,&#8212;into the lies,
            theft, covetousness, adultery, murder, and what not of crime, which
            enter into it,&#8212;he is amazed that he has been so "slow of heart to
            believe," and abandon the iniquity of his deeds.

         </p>
         <p>
            What I have said to show that Christians, even in enlightened and
            gospelized lands, may be blind to the great wickedness of certain
            customs and institutions, serves to introduce the remark; that there
            were probably some customs and institutions, in the time of the
            Apostles, on which it would have been even worse than lost labor for
            them to make direct attacks. Take, for example, the kind of war
            of which we have been speaking. If there are reasons why the
            modern Christian can be insensible to the sin of it, there are far
            stronger reasons why the primitive Christian could be. If the light
            and instruction which have been accumulating for eighteen centuries,
            are scarcely sufficient to convince Christians of its wickedness, is it
            reasonable to suppose that, at the commencement of this long period,
            they could have been successfully taught it? Consider, that at that
            time the literature and sentiment of the world were wholly on the side
            of war; and especially, consider how emphatically the authority of
            civil government and of human law was in favor of its rightfulness.
            Now, to how great an extent such authority covers over and sanctifies
            sin, may be inferred from the fact, that there are many, who,
            notwithstanding they believe slavery to be a most Heaven-daring sin, yet,
            because it is legalized and under the wing of civil government, would
            not have it spoken against. Even Rev. Dr. Miller, in certain resolutions
            which he submitted to the last General Assembly, indicated
            his similar reverence for human laws; and the lamented Dr. Rice
            distinctly recognises, in his letter to Mr. Maxwell, the doctrine that
            the Church is bound to be quiet about every sin which the civil government
            adopts and whitewashes. That the Christian Spectator should
            indorse the Doctor's sentiments on this point is still more worthy of
            remark than that he should utter them. Indeed, I judge from what
            you say on the 68th and 69th pages of your book, that you are yourself
            opposed to calling in question the morality of that which civil
            government approves. But, to doubt the infallibility of civil government,&#8212;to
            speak against Caesar,&#8212;was manifestly held to be quite as
            presumptuous in the time of the Apostles as it is now.

         </p>
         <p>
            Another reason why an Apostle would probably have deemed it
            hopeless to attempt to persuade his disciples, immediately and directly,
            of the sin of war, is to be found in the fact of their feeble and distorted
            perception of truth and duty. We, whose advantage it is to
            have lived all our days in the light of the gospel, and whose ancestors,
            from time immemorial, had the like precious advantage, can hardly
            conceive how very feeble and distorted was that perception. But,
            consider for a moment who those disciples were. They had, most
            of them, but just been taken out of the gross darkness and filth of
            heathenism. In reading accounts which missionaries give of converted
            heathen&#8212;of such, even, as have for ten, fifteen, or twenty
            years, been reputed to be pious&#8212;you are, doubtless, often surprised
            to find how grossly erroneous are their moral perceptions. Their
            false education still cleaves to them. They are yet, to a great extent,
            in the mould of a corrupted public opinion; and, as far from having
            a clear discernment of moral truth, as were the partially unsealed
            eyes which saw "men, as trees, walking." The first letter to the
            Church at Corinth, proves that the new principles implanted in its
            members had not yet purged out the leaven of their old wickedness;
            and that their conceptions of Christian purity and conduct were sadly
            defective. As it was with the Corinthian Christians, so was it to a
            great extent with the other Christians of that age. Now, if the
            Apostles did not directly teach the primitive believers that wars, and
            theatres, and games, and slavery, are sinful, it is because they thought
            it more fit to exercise their ignorant pupils chiefly in the mere alphabet
            and syllables of Christianity. (Acts xv, 28, 29.) The construction
            of words and sentences would naturally follow. The rudiments
            of the gospel, if once possessed by them, would be apt to lead them
            on to greater attainments. Indeed, the love, peace, truth, and other
            elements of holy living inculcated by the Apostles, would, if turned
            to all proper account, be fatal to every, even the most gigantic, system
            of wickedness. Having these elements in their minds and
            hearts, they would not fail of condemning the great and compound
            sin of war whenever they should be led to take it up, examine it,
            resolve it into its constituent parts, and lay these parts for comparison,
            by the side of those elements. But, such an advance was hardly to
            be expected from many of these heathen converts during the brief
            period in which they enjoyed Apostolic instruction; and it is but too
            probable, that most of them died in great ignorance of the sin of
            national wars. Converts from the heathen, in the present age, when

            conviction of the sinfulness of war is spreading in different parts of Christendom, would be more likely to imbibe correct
            views of it.

         </p>
         <p>
            The Apostles "fed with milk" before they fed with meat, as did
            our Saviour, who declared, "I have yet many things to say unto you,
            but ye cannot bear them now." In every community, the foundation
            principles of righteousness must be laid, before there can be fulcrums
            for the levers to be employed in overthrowing the sins which prevail in it.
            You will doubtless, then, agree with me, that it is not probable that
            the Apostles taught their heathen converts, directly and specifically,
            the sinfulness of war. But slaves, in that age, with the exception of the
            comparative few who were reduced to slavery on account of the
            crimes of which they had been judicially convicted, were the spoils
            of war. How often in that age, as was most awfully the fact, on
            the final destruction of Jerusalem, were the slave-markets of the
            world glutted by the captives of war! Until, therefore, they should
            be brought to see the sinfulness of war, how could they see the sinfulness
            of so direct and legitimate a fruit of it as slavery?&#8212;and, if
            the Apostles thought their heathen converts too weak to be instructed
            in the sinfulness of war, how much more would they abstain from
            instructing them, directly and specifically, in the sin of slavery!

         </p>
         <p>
            3d. In proceeding with my reasons why the Apostles did not
            extend their specification of sins to slavery, I remark, that it is apparent
            from the views we have taken, and from others which might have
            been taken, that nothing would have been gained by their making
            direct and specific attacks on the institutions of the civil governments
            under which they lived. Indeed, much might have been lost by their doing so.
            Weak converts, with still many remains of heathenism about them, might in
            this wise have been incurably prejudiced against truths, which, by other
            modes of teaching,&#8212;by general and indirect instructions,&#8212;would probably
            have been lodged in their minds. And there is another point of view in which
            vastly more, even their lives, might have been lost, by the Apostles making
            the direct and specific attacks referred to. I know that you ridicule the
            idea of their consulting their personal safety. But what right have you to
            do so? They did, on many occasions, consult the security of their lives.
            They never perilled them needlessly, and through a presumptuous reliance on
            God. It is the devil, who, in a garbled quotation from the Scriptures,
            lays down, in unlimited terms, the proposition, that God will keep his
            children. But, God promises them protection only when they are in their
            own proper ways. The Saviour himself consulted the safety of his life,
            until his "time" had "full come;" and

            his command to his Apostles was, "when they persecute you in this
            city, flee ye into another." If you suppose me to admit for a moment,
            that regard for the safety of their lives ever kept them from
            the way of their duty, you are entirely mistaken; and, if you continue
            to assert, in the face of my reasoning to the contrary, that on
            the supposition of the sinfulness of slavery, their omission to make
            direct and specific attacks on it would have been a failure of their
            duty, then I can only regret that this reasoning has had no more
            influence upon you.

         </p>
         <p>
            I observe that Professor Hodge agrees with you, that if slavery is
            sin, it would have been specifically attacked by the Apostles at any
            hazard to their lives. This is his conclusion, because they did not
            hesitate to specify and rebuke idolatry. Here is another of the Professor's
            sophisms. The fact, that the Apostles preached against
            idolatry, is no reason at all why, if slavery is sin, they would have
            preached against that also. On the one hand, it is not conceivable
            that the gospel can be preached where there is idolatry, without
            attacking it: for, in setting forth the true God to idolaters, the
            preacher must denounce their false gods. On the other hand, gospel
            sermons can be preached without number, and the true God presented,
            not only in a nation of idolaters, but elsewhere, without one
            allusion being made to such crying sins as slavery, lewdness, and
            intemperance.

         </p>
         <p>
            In the same connexion, Professor Hodge makes the remark
            "We do not expect them (our missionaries) to refrain from denouncing
            the institutions of the heathen as sinful, because they are
            popular, or intimately interwoven with society." If he means by
            this language, that it is the duty of missionaries on going into a
            heathen nation, to array themselves against the civil government, and
            to make direct and specific attacks on its wicked nature and wicked
            administration, then is he at issue, on this point, with the whole
            Christian public; and, if he does not mean this, or what amounts to
            this, I do not see how his remark will avail any thing, in his attempt
            to show that the Apostles made such attacks on whatever sinful
            institutions came under their observation.

         </p>
         <p>
            What I have said on a former page shows sufficiently how fit it is
            for missionaries to the heathen, more especially in the first years of
            their efforts among them, to labor to instruct their ignorant pupils in
            the elementary principles of Christianity, rather than to call their
            attention to the institutions of civil government, the sinfulness of
            which they would not be able to perceive until they had been grounded

            in those elementary principles; and the sinfulness of which, more
            than of any thing else, their prejudices would forbid them to suspect.
            Another reason why the missionary to the heathen should not directly,
            and certainly not immediately, assail their civil governments, is that
            he would thereby arouse their jealousies to a pitch fatal to his
            influence, his usefulness, and most probably his life; and another
            reason is, that this imprudence would effectually close the door, for
            a long time, against all efforts, even the most judicious, to spread the
            gospel amongst a people so needlessly and greatly prejudiced against
            it by an unwise and abrupt application of its principles. For instance,
            what folly and madness it would be for our missionaries to Burmah,
            to make a direct assault on the political institutions of that country!
            How fatal would it be to their lives, and how incalculably injurious
            to the cause entrusted to their hands! And, if this can be said of
            them, after they have spent ten, fifteen, and twenty years, in efforts
            to bring that portion of the heathen world to a knowledge and love
            of the truth, how much more emphatically could it be said if they
            had been in the field of their labors but three or four years! And
            yet, even this short space of time exceeds the average period of the
            Apostles' labor among those different portions of the heathen world
            which they visited;&#8212;labor, too, it must be remembered, not of the
            whole, nor even of half of "the twelve."

         </p>
         <p>
            That the Apostles could not have made direct attacks on the institutions
            of the Roman government, but at the expense of their lives,
            is not to be doubted. Our Saviour well knew how fatal was the
            jealousy of that government to the man who was so unhappy as to
            have excited it; and he accordingly avoided the excitement of it, as
            far as practicable and consistent. His ingenious and beautiful disposition
            of the question, "Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or
            not," is among the instances, in which He studied to shun the displeasure
            of the civil government. Pilate gave striking evidence of
            his unwillingness to excite the jealousy of his government, when,
            every other expedient to induce him to consent to the Saviour's death
            having failed, the bare charge, utterly unproven and groundless, that,
            the Divine prisoner had put forth pretensions, interfering with Caesar's
            rights, availed to procure His death-warrant from the hands of that
            truth-convicted, but man-fearing governor. Had it not availed, Pilate
            would have been exposed to the suspicion of disloyalty to his government;
            and so perilous was this suspicion, that he was ready, at any
            expense to his conscience and sense of justice, to avoid incurring it.

         <p>
            A direct attack on Roman slavery, as it would have called in

            question the rightfulness of war&#8212;the leading policy of the Roman
            government&#8212;would, of course, have been peculiarly perilous to its
            presumptuous author. No person could have made this attack, and
            lived; or, if possibly he might have escaped the vengeance of the
            government, do we not know too much of the deadly wrath of
            slaveholders, to believe that he could have also escaped the summary
            process of Lynch law? If it be at the peril of his life that a Northern
            man travels in the Southern States,&#8212;and that, too, whether he do or
            do not say a word about slavery, or even whether he be or be not an
            abolitionist;&#8212;if your leading men publicly declare, that it is your
            religious duty to put to an immediate death, whenever they come
            within your power, those who presume to say that slavery is sin (and
            such a declaration did a South Carolina gentleman make on the floor
            of congress, respecting the inconsiderable person who is addressing
            you);&#8212;and, if your professing Christians, not excepting ministers
            of the gospel, thirst for the blood of abolitionists<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE3_FN7"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE3_FN7"></a>, as I will abundantly

            show, if you require proof;&#8212;if, in a gospel land, all this be
            so, then I put it to your candor, whether it can reasonably be supposed
            that the Apostles would have been allowed to attack slavery in
            the midst of heathen slaveholders. Why it is that slaveholders will
            not allow a word to be breathed against slavery, I cannot, perhaps,
            correctly judge. Abolitionists think that this unwillingness denotes
            that man is unfit for absolute power over his fellow men. They
            think as unfavorably of the influence of this power on the
            slaveholder, as your own Jefferson did. They think that it tends to make
            him impatient of contradiction, self-willed, supercilious, cruel, murderous,
            devilish; and they think that they can establish this opinion,
            not by the soundest philosophy only, but by the pages of many of
            your own writers, and by those daily scenes of horrid brutality which
            make the Southern States, in the sight both of God and man, one of
            the most frightful and loathsome portions of the world&#8212;of the whole
            world&#8212;barbarous as well as civilized.

         <p><a name="NoteE3_FN7"></a><a href="#FootE3_FN7">A</a>: I
            will relate an incident, to show what a fiend even woman, gentle, lovely
            woman, may become, after she has fallen under the sway of the demon of
            slavery. Said a lady of Savannah, on a visit in the city of New York,
            "I wish he (Rev. Dr. Samuel H. Cox) would come to Savannah. I should
            love to see him tarred and feathered, and his head cut off and carried
            on a pole around Savannah." This lady is a professing Christian. Her
            language stirs me up to retaliate upon her, and to express the wish that
            she would come to the town, and even to the dwelling, in which Dr. Cox
            resides. She would find that man of God&#8212;that man of sanctified
            genius&#8212;as glad to get his enemies into his hands, as she would be to
            get him into the hands of his enemies:&#8212;not, however, for the purpose of
            disgracing and decapitating them, but, that he might pour out upon them the
            forgiveness and love of his generous and
            <i>abolitionized</i> heart. In the city of New
            York there are thousands of whole-souled abolitionists. What a striking
            testimony is it, in behalf of their meekness and forbearance, when a
            southern fury is perfectly secure, in belching out such words of wrath
            in the midst of them! We abolitionists never love
            our principles better, than when we see the slaveholder feeling safe
            amongst us. No man has been more abusive of us than Governor McDuffie;
            and yet, were he to travel in the Northern States, he would meet with no
            unkindness at the hands of any abolitionist. On the other hand, let it be
            known to the governor, that he has within his jurisdiction a prominent
            abolitionist&#8212;one, whose heart of burning love has made him specially
            anxious to persuade the unfortunate slaveholder to be just to himself, to
            his fellow men, and to his God,&#8212;and the governor, true to the horrid
            sentiments of his famous message, would advise that he be "put to
            death without benefit of clergy." Let slaveholders say what they will about
            our blood-thirstiness, there is not one of them who fears to put himself
            in our power. The many of them, who have been beneath my roof, and the
            roofs of other abolitionists, have manifested their confidence in our
            kindness. Were a stranger to the institution of slavery to learn, in answer
            to his inquiries, that "an abolitionist" is "an outlaw
            amongst slaveholders," and that "a slaveholder" is "the kindly entertained
            guest of abolitionists,"&#8212;here would be a puzzle indeed. But the
            solution of it would not fail to be as honorable to the persecuted man
            of peace, as it would be disgraceful to the bloody advocate and executioner
            of Lynch law.
         </p>
         <p>
            I need not render any more reasons why the Apostles did not specifically
            attack slavery; but I will reply to a question, which I am
            sure will be upon your lips all the time you are reading those I have
            rendered. This question is, "If the Apostles did not make such an
            attack on slavery, why may the American abolitionists?" I answer,
            that the difference between the course of the abolitionists and of the
            Apostles, in this matter, is justified by the difference in their
            circumstances. Professor Hodge properly says, that our course should be
            like theirs, "unless it can be shown that their circumstances were so
            different from ours, as to make the rule of duty different in the two
            cases." And he as properly adds, "the obligation to point out and
            establish this difference rests upon the abolitionists."

         </p>
         <p>
            The reasons I have given, why the Apostles did not directly attack
            slavery, do not apply to the abolitionists. The arm of civil power does
            not restrain us from attacking it. To open our lips against the policy
            and institutions of civil government is not certain death. A despotic
            government restricted the efforts of the Apostles to do good. But
            we live under governments which afford the widest scope for exertions
            to bless our fellow men and honor God. Now, if we may not
            avail ourselves of this advantage, simply because the Apostles did
            not have it to avail themselves of, then whatever other interests may
            prosper under a republican government, certain it is, that the cause

            of truth and righteousness is not to be benefited by it. Far better
            never to have had our boasted form of government, if, whilst it
            extends the freedom and multiplies the facilities of the wicked, it
            relieves the righteous of none of the restrictions of a despotic
            government. Again, there is a religious conscience all over this land, and
            an enlightened and gospel sense of right and wrong; on which we
            can and do (as in your Introduction you concede is the fact) bring
            our arguments against slavery to bear with mighty power. But, on
            the other hand, the creating of such a conscience and such a sense,
            in the heathen and semi-heathen amongst whom they lived and labored,
            was the first, and appropriate, and principal work of the Apostles.
            To employ, therefore, no other methods for the moral and religious
            improvement of the people of the United States, than were employed
            by the Apostles for that of the people of the Roman empire, is as
            absurd as it would be to put the highest and lowest classes in a school
            to the same lessons; or a raw apprentice to those higher branches of
            his trade which demand the skill of an experienced workman.

         </p>
         <p>
            I am here reminded of what Professor Hodge says were the means
            relied on by the Saviour and Apostles for abolishing slavery. "It
            was," says he, "by teaching the true nature, dignity, equality, and
            destiny of men; by inculcating the principles of justice and love;
            and by leaving these principles to produce their legitimate effects in
            ameliorating the condition of all classes of society." I would not
            speak disparagingly of such a course of instruction; so far from it,
            I am ready to admit that it is indispensable for the removal of evils,
            in every age and among every people. When general instructions
            of this character shall have ceased to be given, then will all
            wholesome reforms have ceased also. But, I cannot approve of the
            Professor's object in this remark. This object is to induce his readers
            to believe, that these abstract and general instructions are all that is
            needed to effect the termination of slavery. Now, I maintain that one
            thing more is wanting; and that is, the application of these
            instructions&#8212;of the principles contained in them&#8212;to the evil in hand. As
            well may it be supposed, that the mechanic can accomplish his work
            without the application, and by the mere possession, of his tools, as
            that a given reformation can be effected by unapplied general
            principles. Of these principles, American philanthropists have been
            possessed from time immemorial; and yet all the while American slavery
            has been flourishing and growing strong. Of late, however, these
            principles have been brought to bear upon the system, and it
            manifestly is already giving way. The groans of the monster prove that

            those rays of truth, which did not disturb him whilst they continued
            to move in the parallel lines of abstractions and generalities, make it
            quite too hot for him since they are converged to a burning focus
            upon his devoted head. Why is it, for example, that the influence
            of the Boston Recorder and New-York Observer&#8212;why is it, that the
            influence of most of our titled divines&#8212;is decidedly hostile to
            the abolition of slavery? It is not because they are deficient in
            just general sentiments and principles respecting man's duties to
            God and his fellow man. It is simply because they stand opposed
            to the application of these sentiments and principles to the evil in
            question; or, in other words, stand opposed to the Anti-Slavery Society,
            which is the chosen lens of Divine Providence for turning these
            sentiments and principles, with all the burning, irresistible power of
            their concentration, against a giant wickedness. What is the work
            of the Temperance Societies, but to make a specific application of
            general truths and principles to the vice of intemperance? And the
            fact, that from the time of Noah's intoxication, until the organization
            of the American Temperance Society, the desolating tide of intemperance
            had been continually swelling, proves that this reliance on
            unapplied principles, however sound&#8212;this "faith without works"&#8212;is
            utterly vain. Nathan found that nothing, short of a specific application
            of the principles of righteousness, would answer in the case
            of the sin of adultery. He had to abandon all generalities and circuitousness,
            and come plump upon the royal sinner with his "Thou
            art the man." Those divines, whose policy it is to handle slaveholders
            "with gloves," if they must handle them at all, doubtless
            regard Nathan as an exceedingly impolite preacher.

            But, not only is it far less difficult to instruct the people of the
            United States than it was the people of the Roman Empire, in the
            sin of slavery; it is also&#8212;for the reason that the sin is ours, to a
            far greater extent, than it was theirs&#8212;much more important for us
            than for them to be instructed in it. They had no share in the government
            which upheld it. They could not abolish it by law. But,
            on the other hand, the people of the United States are themselves
            the government of their country. They are the co-sovereigns of their
            nation. They uphold slavery by law, and they can put it down by
            law. In this point of view, therefore, slavery is an incomparably
            greater sin in us, than it was in them.

         </p>
         <p>
            Only one other reason will be given why it is more needful to
            overthrow American, than it was to overthrow Roman slavery. The
            Church was then but a handful of "strangers scattered throughout"

            the heathen world. It was made up of those who had little influence,
            and who were esteemed "the filth of the world, and the offscouring of
            all things." It had, probably, little, if any thing, to do with slavery,
            except to suffer its rigors in the persons of many of its members.
            But here, the Church, comprising no very small proportion of the
            whole population, and exerting a mighty influence for good or ill on
            the residue, is tainted, yes, rotten with slavery. In this contrast, we
            not only see another reason why the destruction of American slavery
            is more important than was that of Roman slavery; but we also see,
            that the Apostles could have been little, if at all, actuated by that
            motive, which is more urgent than any other in the breasts of the
            American abolitionists&#8212;the motive of purging the Church of slavery.

         </p>
         <p>
            To return to what you say of the abominations and horrors of
            Greek and Roman slavery:&#8212;I should be doing you great injustice,
            were I to convey the idea that you approve of them. It is admitted
            that you disapprove of them; and, it is also admitted, that no responsibility
            for them rests on the relation of slaveholder and slave, if
            that relation have, as you labor to show, the stamp of Divine approbation.
            You say, that slavery, like marriage, is an institution sanctioned
            by the New Testament; and that, therefore, neither for the
            evils which attend it, nor for any other cause, is it to be argued
            against. This is sound reasoning, on your part; and, if your premises
            are correct, there is no resisting your deduction. We are, in
            that case, not only not to complain of the institution of slavery, but
            we are to be thankful for it. Considering, however, that the whole
            fabric of your argument, in the principal or New Testament division
            of your book, is based on the alleged fact that the New Testament approves
            of slavery, it seems to me that you have contented yourself,
            and sought to make your readers contented, with very slender evidences
            of the truth of this proposition. These evidences are, mainly&#8212;that
            the New Testament does not declare slavery to be a sin: and,
            that the Apostles enjoin upon masters and servants their respective
            duties; and this, too, in the same connexion in which they make
            similar injunctions upon those who stand in the confessedly proper relations
            of life&#8212;the husband and wife, the parent and child. Your other
            evidences, that the New Testament approves of slavery, unimportant
            as they are, will not be left unnoticed.

         </p>
         <p>
            I have attempted to show, that the omission of the New Testament
            to declare slavery to be a sin, is not proof that it is not a sin. I pass
            on to show, that the Apostolic injunction of duties upon masters and
            servants does not prove that slavery is sinless.

         </p>
         <p>
            I have now reached another grand fallacy in your book. It is also
            found in Professor Hodge's article. You, gentlemen, take the liberty
            to depart from our standard English translation of the Bible, and to
            substitute "slaveholder" for "master"&#8212;"slave" for "servant"&#8212;and,
            in substance, "emperor" for "ruler"&#8212;and "subject of an imperial
            government" for "subject of civil government generally." I
            know that this substitution well suits your purposes: but, I know not
            by what right you make it. Professor Hodge tells the abolitionists,
            certainly without much respect for either their intelligence or piety, that
            "it will do no good (for them) to attempt to tear the Bible to pieces."
            There is but too much evidence, that he himself has not entirely
            refrained from the folly and crime, which he is so ready to impute to
            others.

         </p>
         <p>
            I will proceed to offer some reasons for the belief, that when the
            Apostles enjoined on masters and servants their respective duties,
            they had reference to servitude in general, and not to any modification
            of it.

         </p>
         <p>
            1st. You find passages in the New Testament, where you think
            <i>despotes</i> refers to a person
            who is a slaveholder, and <i>doulos</i>
            to a person who is a slave. Admit that you are right: but this (which seems to
            be your only ground for it) does not justify you in translating these
            words "slaveholder" and "slave," whenever it may be advantageous
            to your side of the question to have them thus translated. These
            words, have a great variety of meanings. For instance, there are
            passages in the New Testament where
            <i>despotes</i> means "God"&#8212;Jesus
            Christ"&#8212;Head of a family:" and where
            <i>doulos</i> means "a
            minister or agent"&#8212;a subject of a king"&#8212;a disciple or follower
            of Christ." <i>Despotes</i> and
            <i>doulos</i> are the words used
            in the original of the expression: "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart
            in peace:" <i>doulos</i> in that of the
            expressions, "servant of Christ," and "let him be servant of all." Profane
            writers also use these words in various senses. My full belief is, that these
            words were used in both a generic and special sense, as is the word corn,
            which denotes bread-stuffs in general, and also a particular kind of them;
            as is the word meat, the meaning of which is, sometimes, confined to flesh
            that is eaten, and, at other times, as is frequently the case in the
            Scriptures, extends to food in general; and, as is the word servant,
            which is suitable, either in reference to a particular form of servitude,
            or to servitude in general. There is a passage in the second chapter
            of Acts, which is, of itself, perhaps, sufficient to convince an unbiased
            mind, that the Apostles used the word
            <i>doulos</i> in a, generic, as well as

            in a special sense. <i>Doulos</i> and
            <i>doule</i> are the words in the phrase:
            "And on my servants and on my handmaidens." A reference to the prophecy
            as it stands; in Joel 2: 28, 29, makes it more obvious, that
            persons in servitude are referred to under the words
            <i>doulos</i> and
            <i>doule</i>; and, that the predicted
            blessing was to be shed upon persons of all
            ages, classes, and conditions&#8212;upon old men and young men&#8212;upon
            sons and daughters&#8212;and upon man-servants and maid-servants.
            But, under the interpretation of those, who, like Professor Hodge
            and yourself, confine the meaning of
            <i>doulos</i> and
            <i>doule</i> to a species of
            servants, the prophecy would have reference to persons of all ages,
            classes, and conditions&#8212;<em>excepting certain descriptions of
               servants</em>. Under this interpretation, we are brought to the absurd
            conclusion, that the spirit is to be poured out upon the master and his
            slaves&#8212;<em>but not upon his hired servants</em>.

         </p>
         <p>
            I trust that enough has been said, under this my first head, to show
            that the various senses in which the words
            <i>despotes</i> and
            <i>doulos</i> are employed,
            justify me in taking the position, that whenever we meet with
            them, we are to determine, from the nature of the case, and from the
            connexion in which they are used, whether they refer to servitude in
            general, or to a species of it.

         </p>
         <p>
            2d. The confinement of the meaning of the words in question
            supposes, what neither religion nor common sense allows us to suppose,
            that slaveholders and slaves, despots and those in subjection to
            them, were such especial favorites of the Apostles, as to obtain from
            them specific instructions in respect to their relative duties, whilst
            all other masters and servants, and all other rulers and subjects,
            throughout all future time, were left unprovided with such instructions.
            According to this supposition, when slavery and despotism shall,
            agreeably to Professor Hodge's expectations, have entirely ceased,
            there will be not one master nor servant, not one ruler nor subject in
            the whole earth, to fall, as such, under the Apostolic injunctions.

         </p>
         <p>
            3d. You admit that there were hirelings, in a community of primitive
            believers; and I admit, for the moment, that there were slaves
            in it. Now, under my interpretation of the Apostolic injunction, all
            husbands, all wives, all parents, all children, and all servants, in this
            community, are told their respective duties: but, under yours, these
            duties are enjoined on all husbands, all wives, all parents, all children,
            and a <em>part of the servants</em>. May we not reasonably complain
            of your interpretation, that it violates analogy?

         </p>
         <p>
            Imagine the scene, in which a father, in the Apostolic age, assembles
            his family to listen to a letter from the glowing Peter, or "such

            an one as Paul the aged." The letter contains instructions respecting
            the relative duties of life. The venerable pair, who stand in the
            conjugal and parental relations, receive, with calm thankfulness, what
            is addressed to themselves;&#8212;the bright-eyed little ones are eager to
            know what the Apostle says to children&#8212;a poor slave blesses God
            for his portion of the Apostolic counsel;&#8212;and the scene would be
            one of unmingled joy, if the writer had but addressed hired servants,
            as well as slaves. One of the group goes away to weep, because the
            Apostle had remembered the necessities of all other classes of men,
            and forgotten those of the hireling. Sir, do you believe that the Apostle
            was guilty of such an omission? I rejoice that my side of the
            question between us, does not call for the belief of what is so improbable
            and unnatural&#8212;and, withal, so dishonoring to the memory of the
            Apostle.

         </p>
         <p>
            4th. Another reason for believing, that the Apostles intended no
            such limitation as that which you impose upon their words, is, that
            their injunctions are as applicable to the other classes of persons
            occupying these relations, as they are to the particular class to which
            you confine them. The hired servant, as well as the slave, needs to
            be admonished of the sins of "eye service" and "purloining;" and
            the master of voluntary, as well as involuntary servants, needs to be
            admonished to "give that which is just and equal." The ruler in a
            republic, or, in a limited monarchy, as well as the despot, requires to
            be reminded, that he is to be "a minister of God for good." So the
            subject of one kind of civil government, as well as that of another,
            needs to be told to be "subject unto the higher powers."

         </p>
         <p>
            I need not extend my remarks to prove, that
            <i>despotes</i> and
            <i>doulos</i>
            are, in the case before us, to be taken in their comprehensive sense
            of master and servant: and, clearly, therefore, the abolitionist is not
            guilty of violating your rule, "not to interfere with a civil relation (in
            another place, you say, 'any of the existing relations of life') for which,
            and to regulate which, either Christ or his Apostles have prescribed
            regulations." He believes, as fully as yourself, that the relation of
            master and servant is approved of God. It is the slavery modification
            of it&#8212;the slaveholder's abuse and perversion of the relation, in
            reducing the servant to a chattel&#8212;which, he believes, is not approved
            of God.

         </p>
         <p>
            For the sake of the argument, I will admit, that the slave alone, of
            all classes of servants, was favored with specific instructions from the
            Apostles: and then, how should we account for the selection? In no
            other way, can I conceive, than, on the ground, that his lot is so

            peculiarly hard&#8212;so much harder than that of persons under other forms
            of servitude&#8212;that he needs, whilst they do not, Apostolic counsel and
            advice to keep him just, and patient, and submissive. Let me be
            spared from the sin of reducing a brother man to such a lot. Your
            doctrine, therefore, that the Apostles addressed slaves only, and not
            servants in general, would not, were its correctness admitted, lift you
            out of all the difficulties in your argument.

         </p>
         <p>
            Again, does it necessarily follow from this admission, that the relation
            of slaveholder and slave is sinless? Was the despotism of the
            Roman government sinless? I do not ask whether the <em>abuses</em> of
            civil government, in that instance, were sinless. But, I ask, was a
            government, despotic in its constitution, depriving all its subjects of
            political power, and extending absolute control over their property
            and persons&#8212;was such a government, independently of the consideration
            of its <em>abuses</em>, (if indeed we may speak of the abuses of what is
            in itself an <em>abuse</em>,) sinless? I am aware, that Prof. Hodge says,
            that it was so: and, when he classes despotism and slavery with
            <i>adiaphora</i>, "things indifferent;"
            and allows no more moral character to them than to a table or a broomstick, I
            trust no good man envies his optics. May I not hope that you, Mr. Smylie,
            perceive a difference between despotism and an "indifferent thing." May I not
            hope, that you will, both as a Republican and a Christian, take the ground,
            that despotism has a moral character, and a bad one? When our fathers
            prayed, and toiled, and bled, to obtain for themselves and their children
            the right of self-government, and to effect their liberation from a
            power, which, in the extent and rigor of its despotism, is no more to
            be compared to the Roman government, than the "little finger" to the
            "loins," I doubt not, that they felt that despotism had a moral, and
            a very bad moral character. And so would Prof. Hodge have felt,
            had he stood by their side, instead of being one of their ungrateful
            sons. I say ungrateful&#8212;for, who more so, than he who publishes
            doctrines that disparage the holy cause in which they were embarked,
            and exhibits them, as contending for straws, rather than for principles?
            Tell me, how long will this Republic endure after our people shall
            have imbibed the doctrine, that the <i>nature</i> of civil
            government is an indifferent thing: and that the poet was right when he said,

         </p>
         <div class="lg">"For forms of government let <em>fools</em> contest?"<br><br></div>
         <p>
            This, however, is but one of many doctrines of ruinous tendency to
            the cause of civil liberty, advanced by pro-slavery writers to sustain
            their system of oppression.

         </p>
         <p>
            It would surely be superfluous to go into proofs, that the Roman
            government was vicious and wicked in its constitution and nature.
            Nevertheless, the Apostle enjoined submission to it, and taught its
            subjects how to demean themselves under it. Here, then, we have
            an instance, in which we cannot argue the sinlessness of a relation,
            from the fact of Apostolic injunctions on those standing in it. Take
            another instance. The Chaldeans went to a foreign land, and enslaved
            its people&#8212;as members of your guilty partnership have done
            for some of the slaves you now own, and for the ancestors of others.
            And God destroyed the Chaldeans expressly "for all their evil that
            they had done in Zion." But, wicked as they were, for having instituted
            this relation between themselves and the Jews, God, nevertheless,
            tells the Jews to submit to it. He tells them, "Serve the King
            of Babylon." He even says, "seek the peace of the city, whither I
            have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the Lord
            for it; for, in the peace thereof, shall ye have peace." Here then,
            we have another instance, in addition to that of the Roman despot
            and his subjects, in which the Holy Spirit prescribed regulations for
            wicked relations. You will, at least, allow, that the relation established
            by the Chaldeans between themselves and the captive Jews,
            was wicked. But, you will perhaps say, that this is not a relation
            coming within the contemplation of your rule. Your rule speaks of
            a civil relation, and also of the existing relations of life. But, the
            relation in question, being substantially that of slaveholder and slave,
            is, according to your own showing, a civil relation. Perhaps you will
            say, it is not an "existing relation of life." But what do you mean
            by "an existing relation of life?" Do you mean, that it is a relation
            approved of God? If you do, and insist that the relation of slaveholder
            and slave is "an existing relation of life," then you are guilty
            of begging the great question between us. Your rule, therefore, can
            mean nothing more than this&#8212;that any relation is rightful, for which
            the Bible prescribes regulations. But the relation referred to between
            the Chaldeans and Jews, proves the falsity of the rule. Again,
            when a man compels me to go with him, is not the compelled relation
            between him and me a sinful one? And the relation of robber and
            robbed, which a man institutes between himself and me, is not this
            also sinful? But, the Bible has prescribed regulations for the relations
            in both these cases. In the one, it requires me to "go with
            him twain;" and, in the other, to endure patiently even farther spoliation
            and, "let him have (my) cloak also." In these cases, also, do

            we see the falsity of your rule&#8212;and none the less clearly, because
            the relations in question are of brief duration.

         </p>
         <p>
            Before concluding my remarks on this topic, let me say, that your
            doctrine, that God has prescribed no rules for the behaviour of persons
            in any other than the just relations of life, reflects no honor on His
            compassion. Why, even we "cut-throat" abolitionists are not so
            hard-hearted as to overlook the subjects of a relation, because it is wicked.
            Pitying, as we do, our poor colored brethren, who are forced into a
            wicked relation, which, by its very nature and terms, and not by its
            <em>abuses</em>, as you would say, has robbed them of their all&#8212;even we
            would, nevertheless, tell them to "resist not evil"&#8212;to be obedient
            unto their own masters"&#8212;not purloining, but showing all good
            fidelity." We would tell them, as God told the captive Jews, to
            "seek the peace of those, whither they are carried away captives,
            and to pray unto the Lord" for them: and our hope of their emancipation
            is not, as it is most slanderously and wickedly reported to be,
            in their deluging the South with blood: but, it is, to use again those
            sweet words of inspiration, that "in the peace thereof they shall have
            peace." We do not communicate with the slave; but, if we did, we
            would teach him, that our hope of his liberation is grounded largely
            in his patience, and that, if he would have us drop his cause from our
            hands, he has but to take it into his own, and attempt to accomplish
            by violence, that which we seek to effect through the power of truth
            and love on the understanding and heart of his master.

         </p>
         <p>
            Having disposed of your reasons in favor of the rightfulness of the
            relation of slaveholder and slave, I will offer a few reasons for believing
            that it is not rightful.

         </p>
         <p>
            1st. My strongest reason is, that the great and comprehensive
            principles, and the whole genius and spirit of Christianity, are opposed to
            slavery.

         </p>
         <p>
            2d. In the case of Pharoah and his Jewish slaves, God manifested
            his abhorrence of the relation of slavery. The fact that the slavery
            in this case was political, instead of domestic, and, therefore, of a
            milder type than that of Southern slavery, does not forbid my reasoning
            from the one form to the other. Indeed, if I may receive your
            declaration on this point, for the truth, I need not admit that the type
            of the slavery in question is milder than that of Southern slavery;&#8212;for
            you say, that "their (the Jews) condition was that of the most
            abject bondage or slavery." But the supposition that it is milder,
            being allowed to be correct, would only prove, that God's abhorrence
            of Southern bondage as much exceeds that which he expressed of

            Egyptian bondage, as the one system is more full than the other of
            oppression and cruelty.

         </p>
         <p>
            We learn from the Bible, that it was not because of the <em>abuses</em>
            of the Egyptian system of bondage, but, because of its sinful nature,
            that God required its abolition. He did not command Pharaoh to
            cease from the <em>abuses</em> of the system, and to correct his
            administration of it, but to cease from the system itself. "I have heard,"
            says God, "the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in
            bondage;"&#8212;not whom the Egyptians, availing themselves of their
            absolute power, compel to make brick without straw, and seek to
            waste and exterminate by the murder of their infant children;&#8212;but
            simply "whom the Egyptians keep in bondage." These hardships
            and outrages were but the leaves and branches. The root of the
            abomination was the bondage itself, the assertion of absolute and
            slaveholding power by "a new king over Egypt, which knew not
            Joseph." In the next verse God says: "I will rid you"&#8212;not only
            from the burdens and abuses, as you would say, of bondage,&#8212;but
            "out of their (the Egyptians) bondage" itself&#8212;out of the relation in
            which the Egyptians oppressively and wickedly hold you.

         </p>
         <p>
            God sends many messages to Pharaoh. In no one of them does
            He reprove him for the abuses of the relation into which he had forced
            the Jews. In no one of them is he called on to correct the evils
            which had grown out of that relation. But, in every one, does God
            go to the root of the evil, and command Pharaoh, "let my people
            go"&#8212;"let my people go, that they may serve me." The abolitionist
            is reproachfully called an "ultraist" and "an immediatist." It
            seems that God was both, when dealing with this royal slaveholder:&#8212;for
            He commanded Pharaoh, not to mitigate the bondage of the
            Israelites, but to deliver them from it&#8212;and that, too, immediately.
            The system of slavery is wicked in God's sight, and, therefore, did
            He require of Pharaoh its immediate abandonment. The phrase,
            "let my people go, that they may serve me," shows most strikingly
            one feature of resemblance between Egyptian and American slavery.
            Egyptian slavery did not allow its subjects to serve God, neither does
            American. The Egyptian master stood between his slave and their
            God: and how strikingly and awfully true is it, that the American
            master occupies the like position! Not only is the theory of slavery,
            the world over, in the face of God's declaration; "all souls are mine:"
            but American slaveholders have brought its practical character to
            respond so fully to its theory&#8212;they have succeeded, so well, in excluding

            the light and knowledge of God from the minds of their slaves&#8212;that
            they laugh at His claim to "all souls."

         </p>
         <p>
            3d. Paul, in one of his letters to the Corinthian Church, tells servants&#8212;say
            slaves, to suit your views&#8212;if they may be free, to prefer
            freedom to bondage. But if it be the duty of slaves to prefer freedom
            to bondage, how clearly is it the correlative duty of the master to
            grant it to him! You interpret the Apostle's language, in this case, as
            I do; and it is not a little surprising, that, with your interpretation of
            it, you can still advocate slavery. You admit, that Paul says&#8212;I use
            your own words&#8212;"a state of freedom, on the whole, is the best."
            Now, it seems to me, that this admission leaves you without excuse,
            for defending slavery. You have virtually yielded the ground. And
            this admission is especially fatal to your strenuous endeavors to class
            the relation of master and slave with the confessedly proper relations
            of life, and to show that, like these, it is approved of God. Would
            Paul say to the child, "a state of freedom" from parental government
            "on the whole is the best?" Would he say to the wife, "a state of
            freedom from your conjugal bonds" on the whole is the best?
            Would he say to the child and wife, in respect to this freedom, "use
            it rather?" Would he be thus guilty of attempting to annihilate the
            family relation?

         </p>
         <p>
            Does any one wonder, that the Apostle did not use stronger language,
            in advising to a choice and enjoyment of freedom? It is
            similar to that which a pious, intelligent, and prudent abolitionist
            would now use under the like circumstances. Paul was endeavoring
            to make the slave contented with his hard lot, and to show him how
            unimportant is personal liberty, compared with liberation from spiritual
            bondage: and this explains why it is, that he spoke so briefly and
            moderately of the advantages of liberty. His advice to the slave to
            accept the boon of freedom, was a purely incidental remark: and we
            cannot infer from it, how great stress he would have laid on the evils
            of slavery, and on the blessings of liberty, in a discourse treating
            directly and mainly of those subjects. What I have previously said,
            however, shows that it would, probably, have been in vain, and worse
            than in vain, for him to have come out, on any occasion whatever,
            with an exposition of the evils of slavery.

         </p>
         <p>
            On the thirty-second page of your book, you say, "Masters cannot,
            according to the command of Christ, render to their slaves that
            which is just and equal, if you abolish the relation; for, then they
            will cease to be masters." Abolish any of the relations for which
            regulations are provided "in the New Testament, and, in effect, you

            abolish some of the laws of Christ." But, we have just seen that
            Paul was in favor of abolishing the relation of master and slave;
            which, as you insist, is a relation for which regulations are provided
            in the New Testament. It is, therefore, irresistibly deduced from
            your own premises, that he was in favor of abolishing "the laws of
            Christ." It would require but little, if any, extension of your doctrine,
            to make it wrong to remove all the graven images out of a nation.
            For, in that event, the law of God against bowing down to them
            would have nothing left to act upon. It would thenceforth be inoperative.

         </p>
         <p>
            4th. Another reason for believing, that the Apostles did not approve
            of the slavery modification of servitude, is found in Paul's injunction;
            "Remember them that are in bonds as bound with them." I admit,
            that it is probable that others as well as slaves, are referred to in
            this injunction: but it certainly is not probable, that others, to the
            exclusion of slaves, are referred to. But, even on the supposition
            that slaves are not referred to, but those only who are tenants of
            prisons, let me ask you which you would rather be&#8212;a slave or a
            prisoner, as Paul probably was when he wrote this injunction?&#8212;and
            whether your own description of the wretched condition of the Roman
            slave, does not prepare you to agree with me, that if the Apostle could
            ask sympathy for the prisoner, who, with all his deprivations, has still
            the protection of law, it is not much more due to the poor slave, who
            has no protection whatever against lawless tyranny and caprice!

         </p>
         <p>
            But to proceed, if slaves are the only, or even a part of the persons
            referred to in the injunction, then you will observe, that the Apostle
            does not call for the exercise of sympathy towards those who are
            said to be suffering what you call the <em>abuses</em> of slavery; but
            towards those who are so unhappy as to be but the subjects of it&#8212;towards
            those who are "in bonds." The bare relation of a slave is itself so
            grievous, as to call for compassion towards those who bear it. Now,
            if this relation were to be classed with the approved relations of life,
            why should the Apostle have undertaken to awaken compassion for
            persons, simply because they were the subject, of it? He never
            asked for sympathy for persons, simply because they were parties to
            the relations of husband and wife, parent and child. It may be
            worthy of notice, that the injunction under consideration is found in
            Paul's letter to the Jewish Christians. This attempt to awaken pity
            in behalf of the slave, and to produce abhorrence of slavery, was
            made upon these, and not upon the Gentile Christians; because, perhaps,
            that they, who had always possessed the Oracles of God, could

            bear it; and they who had just come up out of the mire of heathenism,
            could not. If this explanation be just, it enforces my argument for
            ascribing to causes, other than the alleged sinfulness of the institution,
            the Apostle's omission to utter specific rebukes of slavery.

         </p>
         <p>
            5th. Another reason for believing that the slavery modification of
            servitude should not be classed with the confessedly proper relations
            with which you class it, is the conclusive one, that it interferes with,
            and tends to subvert, and does actually subvert, these relations. The
            Apostles prescribe duties, which are necessary to sustain these relations,
            and make them fruitful sources of happiness to the parties to
            them. Among these duties are the following: "Wives, submit yourselves
            to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord"&#8212;"Children,
            obey your parents"&#8212;"Husbands, dwell with them" (your wives).
            But slavery, where it does not make obedience to these commands
            utterly impossible, conditions it on the permission of usurpers, who
            have presumed to step between the laws of God and those on whom
            they are intended to bear. Slavery, not the law of God, practically
            determines whether husbands shall dwell with their wives: and an
            amount of anguish, which God alone can compute, testifies that
            slavery has thus determined, times without number, that husbands
            shall not dwell with their wives. A distinguished gentleman, who
            has been much at the South, is spending a little time in my family.
            He told me but this day, that he had frequently known the air filled
            with shrieks of anguish for a whole mile around the spot, where, under
            the hammer of the auctioneer, the members of a family were undergoing
            an endless separation from each other. It was but last week,
            that a poor fugitive reached a family, in which God's commands,
            "Hide the outcasts, betray not him that wandereth"&#8212;"Hide not
            thyself from thy own flesh"&#8212;are not a dead letter. The heaviest
            burden of his heart is, that he has not seen his wife for five years,
            and does not expect to see her again: his master, in Virginia, having
            sold him to a Georgian, and his wife to an inhabitant of the District
            of Columbia. Whilst the law of God requires wives to "submit
            themselves to their husbands, as it is fit in the Lord;" the law of
            slavery commands them, under the most terrific penalties, to submit
            to every conceivable form of violence, and the most loathsome pollution,
            "as it is fit" in the eyes of slaveholders&#8212;no small proportion
            of whom are, as a most natural fruit of slavery, abandoned to brutality
            and lust. The laws of South Carolina and Georgia make it an
            offence punishable with death, "if any slave shall presume to strike a
            white person." By the laws of Maryland and Kentucky, it is enacted

            "if any negro, mulatto, or Indian, bond or free, shall, at any
            time, lift his or her hand in opposition to any person, not being a negro
            or Indian, he or she shall, in the first-mentioned State, suffer the
            penalty of cropped ears; and, in the other, thirty-nine lashes on his
            or her bare back, well laid on, by order of the justice." In Louisiana
            there is a law&#8212;for the enactment of which, slavery is, of course,
            responsible&#8212;in these words: "Free people of color ought never to
            insult or strike white people, nor presume to conceive themselves
            equal to the whites: but, on the contrary, they ought <em>to yield to them
               on every occasion</em>, and never speak or answer them but with respect,
            under the penalty of imprisonment, according to the nature of the
            offence." The following extract of a letter, written to me from the
            South, by a gentleman who still resides there, serves to show how
            true it is, that "on every occasion," the colored person must yield to
            the white, and, especially, if the white be clothed with the authority
            of an ambassador of Christ. "A negro was executed in Autauga
            Co., not long since, for the murder of his master. The latter, it
            seems, attempted to violate the wife of his slave in his presence,
            when the negro enraged, smote the wretch to the ground. And this
            master&#8212;this brute&#8212;this fiend&#8212;was a preacher of the gospel, in
            regular standing!" In a former part of this communication, I said
            enough to show, that slavery prevents children from complying with
            the command to obey their parents. But, in reply to what I have
            said of these outrages on the rights of husbands and wives, parents
            and children, you maintain, that they are no part of the system of
            slavery. Slaveholders, however, being themselves judges, they are a
            part of it, or, at least, are necessary to uphold it; else they would not
            by deliberate, solemn legislation, authorize them. But, be this as it
            may, it is abundantly proven, that slavery is, essentially and inevitably,
            at war with the sacred rights of the family state. Let me say,
            then, in conclusion under this head, that in whatever other company
            you put slavery, place it not in that of the just relations of husband
            and wife, parent and child. They can no more company with each
            other, than can fire with water. Their natures are not only totally
            opposite to, but destructive of, each other.

         </p>
         <p>
            6th. The laws, to which you refer on the sixty-eighth page of your
            book, tend to prove, and, so far as your admission of the necessity
            of them goes, do prove, that the relation of slaveholder and slave
            does not deserve a place, in the class of innocent and proper relations.
            You there say, that the writings of "such great and good
            men as Wesley, Edwards, Porteus, Paley, Horsley, Scott, Clark,

            Wilberforce, Sharp, Clarkson, Fox, Johnson, and a host of as good
            if not equally great, men of later date," have made it necessary for
            the safety of the institution of slavery, to pass laws, forbidding millions
            of our countrymen to read. You should have, also, mentioned
            the horrid sanctions of these laws&#8212;stripes, imprisonment, and death.
            Now, these laws disable the persons on whom they bear, from fulfilling
            God's commandments, and, especially, His commandment to
            "search the Scriptures." They are, therefore, wicked. What then,
            in its moral character, must be a relation, which, to sustain it, requires
            the aid of wicked laws?&#8212;and, how entirely out of place must it be,
            when you class it with those just relations of life, that, certainly,
            require none of the support, which, you admit, is indispensable to
            the preservation of the relation of slaveholder and slave! It is
            true, that you attempt to justify the enactment of the laws in question,
            by the occasions which you say led to it. But, every law
            forbidding what God requires, is a wicked law&#8212;under whatever pretexts,
            or for whatever purposes, it may have been enacted. Let the
            occasions which lead to a wicked measure be what they may, the
            wickedness of the measure is still sufficient to condemn it.

            In the case before us, we see how differently different persons are
            affected by the same fact. Whilst the stand taken against slavery
            by Wesley, Edwards, and the other choice spirits you enumerate,
            serves but to inspire you with concern for its safety, it would, of itself,
            and without knowing their reasons for it, be well nigh enough to destroy
            my confidence in the institution. Let me ask you, Sir, whether
            it would not be more reasonable for those, who are so industriously
            engaged in insulating the system of American slavery, and shrouding
            it with darkness, to find less fault with the bright and burning light
            which the writings of the wisest and best men pour upon it, and more
            with the system which "hateth the light, neither cometh to the light."

         </p>
         <p>
            You would have your readers believe, that the blessings of education
            are to be withheld from your slaves&#8212;only "until the storm shall
            be overblown," and that you hope that "Satan's being let loose will
            be but for a little season." I say nothing more about the last expression,
            than that I most sincerely desire you may penitently regret
            having attributed the present holy excitement against slavery to the
            influences of Satan. By "the storm" you, doubtless, mean the excitement
            produced by the publications and efforts of the American
            Anti-Slavery Society. Now, I will not suppose that you meant to
            deceive your readers on this point. You are, nevertheless, inexcusable
            for using language so strikingly calculated to lead them into

            error. It is not yet three years since that Society was organized:
            but the statute books of some of the slave States contain laws, forbidding
            the instruction of slaves in reading, which were enacted long
            before you and I were born. As long ago as the year 1740, South
            Carolina passed a law, forbidding to teach slaves to write. Georgia
            did so in 1770. In the year 1800, thirty-three years before "the
            storm" of the Anti-Slavery Society began to blow, South Carolina
            passed a law, forbidding "assemblies of slaves, free negroes, &amp;c.,
            for the purpose of mental instruction." In the Revised Code of Virginia
            of 1819, is a law similar to that last mentioned. In the year
            1818, the city of Savannah forbade by an ordinance, the instruction
            of all persons of color, either free or bond, in reading and writing.
            I need not specify any more of these man-crushing, soul-killing,
            God-defying laws;&#8212;nor need I refer again to the shocking penalties
            annexed to the violation of most of them. I conclude my remarks
            under this head, with the advice, that, in the next edition of your book,
            you do not assign the anti-slavery excitement, which is now spreading
            over our land, as the occasion of the passage of the laws in question.

            7th. The only other reason I will mention for believing, that the
            slavery modification of servitude is not approved of God, is, that it
            has never been known <em>to work well</em>&#8212;never been known to promote
            man's happiness or God's glory. Wickedness and wretchedness are,
            so uniformly, the product of slavery, that they must be looked upon,
            not as its abuses, but as its legitimate fruits. Whilst all admit, that
            the relations of the family state are, notwithstanding their frequent
            perversions, full of blessings to the world; and that, but for them,
            the world would be nothing better than one scene of pollution and
            wo;&#8212;to what history of slavery will you refer me, for proof of its
            beneficent operation? Will it be to the Bible history of Egyptian
            slavery? No&#8212;for that informs us of the exceeding wickedness and
            wretchedness of Egyptian slavery. Will it be to the history of
            Greek and Roman slavery? No&#8212;for your own book acknowledges
            its unutterable horrors and abominations. Will you refer me to the
            history of the West Indies for proofs of the happy fruits of slavery?
            Not until the earth is no more, will its polluted and bloody pages
            cease to testify against slavery. And, when we have come down to
            American slavery, you will not even open the book which records
            such facts, as that its subjects are forbidden to be joined in wedlock,
            and to read the Bible. No&#8212;you will not presume to look for a
            single evidence of the benign influences of a system, where, by the
            admission of your own ecclesiastical bodies, it has turned millions of

            men into heathen. I say nothing now of your beautiful and harmless
            theories of slavery:&#8212;but this I say, that when you look upon slavery
            as it has existed, or now exists, either amidst the darkness of Mahommedanism
            or the light of Christianity, you dare not, as you hope
            for the Divine favor, say that it is a Heaven-descended institution;
            and that, notwithstanding it is like Ezekiel's roll, "written within
            and without with lamentations and mourning and wo," it, nevertheless,
            bears the mark of being a boon from God to man.

         </p>
         <p>
            Having disposed of your "strong reasons" for the position, that
            the New Testament authorizes slavery, I proceed to consider your
            remaining reasons for it.

         </p>
         <p>
            Because it does not appear, that our Saviour and the Apostle
            Peter told certain centurions, who, for the sake of the argument, I
            will admit were slaveholders, that slaveholding is sinful, you argue,
            and most confidently too, that it is not sinful. But, it does not
            appear, that the Saviour and the Apostle charged <em>any</em> sinful
            practices upon them. Then, by your logic, all their other practices, as well
            as their slaveholding, were innocent, and these Roman soldiers were
            literally perfect.&#8212;Again; how do you know that the Saviour and the
            Apostle did not tell them, on the occasion you refer to, that they were
            sinners for being slaveholders? The fact, that the Bible does not
            inform us that they told them so, does not prove that they did not;
            much less does it prove, that they did not tell them so subsequently
            to their first interview with them. And again, the admission that
            they did not specifically attack slavery, at any of their interviews
            with the centurions, or on any other occasions whatever, would not
            justify the inference, that it is sinless. I need not repeat the reasoning
            which makes the truth of this remark apparent.

         </p>
         <p>
            You refer to the Saviour's declaration of the unequaled faith of
            one of these centurions, with the view of making it appear that a
            person of so great faith could not be a great sinner. But, how
            long had he exercised this, or, indeed, any Christian faith? That
            he was on good terms with the Jews, and had built them a synagogue,
            is quite as strong evidence, that he had not, as that he had,
            previously to that time, believed in Jesus:&#8212;and, if he had not, then
            his faith, however strong, and his conversion, however decided, are
            nothing towards proving that slavery is sinless.

         </p>
         <p>
            It is evident, that the Apostle was sent to Cornelius for the single
            purpose of inculcating the doctrine of the remission of sin, through
            faith in Christ.

         </p>
         <p>
            I proceed to examine another of your arguments. From Paul's

            declaration to the Elders at Miletus, "I have not shunned to declare
            unto you all the counsel of God," taken in connexion with the fact,
            that the Bible does not inform us that he spoke to them of slaveholding,
            you confidently and exultingly infer that it is innocent. Here,
            again, you prove too much, and therefore, prove nothing. It does
            not appear that he specified a hundredth part of their duties. If he
            did not tell them to abstain from slaveholding, neither did he tell
            them to abstain from games and theatres. But, his silence about
            slaveholding proves to your mind its sinlessness: equally then
            should his silence about games and theatres satisfy you of their innocence.
            Two radical errors run through a great part of your book.
            They are, that the Apostle gave specific instructions concerning all
            duties, and that the Bible contains these instructions. But, for these
            errors, your book would be far less objectionable than it is. I might,
            perhaps, rather say, that but for these, you could not have made up
            your book.

         </p>
         <p>
            And now, since Paul's address to the Elders has been employed
            by you in behalf of slavery, allow me to try its virtue against slavery:
            and, if it should turn out that you are slain with your own weapon, it
            will not be the first time that temerity has met with such a fate. I
            admit, that the Apostle does not tell the Elders of any wrong thing
            which they had done; but there are some wrong things from which
            he had himself abstained, and some right things which he had himself
            done, of which he does tell them. He tells them, for instance,
            that he had not been guilty of coveting what was another's, and also,
            that with his own hands he had ministered to his own necessities
            and those of others: and he further tells them, that they ought to
            copy his example, and labor, as he had done, "to support the weak."
            Think you, sir, from this language that Paul was a slaveholder&#8212;and,
            that his example was such, as to keep lazy, luxurious slaveholders
            in countenance? The slaveholder is guilty of coveting, not
            only all a man has, but even the man himself. The slaveholder will
            not only not labor with his hands to supply the wants of others, and
            "to support the weak;" but he makes others labor to supply his
            wants:&#8212;yes, makes them labor unpaid&#8212;night and day&#8212;in storm, as
            well as in sunshine&#8212;under the lash&#8212;bleeding&#8212;groaning&#8212;dying&#8212;and
            all this, not to minister to his actual needs, but to his luxuriousness
            and sensuality.

         </p>
         <p>
            You ridicule the idea of the abolition of slavery, because it would
            make the slaveholder "so poor, as to oblige him to take hold of the
            maul and wedge himself&#8212;he must catch, curry, and saddle his own

            horse&#8212;he must black his own brogans (for he will not be able to buy
            boots)&#8212;his wife must go herself to the wash-tub&#8212;take hold of the
            scrubbing broom, wash the pots, and cook all that she and her rail-mauler
            will eat." If Paul were, as you judge he was, opposed to the
            abolition of slavery, it is at least certain, from what he says of the
            character of his life in his address to the Elders, that his opposition
            did not spring from such considerations as array you against it. In
            his estimation, manual labor was honorable. In a slaveholding community,
            it is degrading. It is so in your own judgment, or you
            would not hold up to ridicule those humble employments, which
            reflect disgrace, only where the moral atmosphere is tainted by slavery.
            That the pernicious influences of slavery in this respect are
            felt more or less, in every part of this guilty nation, is but too true.
            I put it to your candor, sir, whether the obvious fact, that slavery
            makes the honest labor of the hands disreputable, is not a weighty
            argument against the supposition that God approves it? I put it to
            your candor, sir, whether the fact, which you, at least, cannot gain-say,
            that slavery makes even ministers of the gospel despise the
            employments of seven-eighths of the human family, and, consequently,
            the humble classes, who labor in them&#8212;I put it to your candor,
            whether the institution, which breeds such contempt of your fellow-men
            and fellow Christians, must not be offensive to Him, who commands
            us to "Honor all men, and love the brotherhood?"

         </p>
         <p>
            In another argument, you attempt to show, that Paul's letter to
            Philemon justifies slaveholding, and also the apprehension and return
            of fugitive slaves. After having recited the Resolution of the Chilicothe
            Presbytery&#8212;"that to apprehend a slave who is endeavoring to
            escape from slavery, with a view to restore him to his master, is a
            direct violation of the Divine law, and, when committed by a member
            of the church, ought to subject him to censure"&#8212;you undertake
            to make your readers believe, that Paul's sending Onesimus to Philemon,
            is a case coming fairly within the purview of the resolution.
            Let us see if it does. A man by the name of Onesimus was converted
            to Christianity, under Paul's ministry at Rome. Paul learnt
            that he had formerly been a servant&#8212;say a slave&#8212;of Philemon, who
            was a "dearly beloved" Christian: and believing that his return to
            his old master would promote the cause of Christ, and beautifully
            exemplify its power, he advised him to return to him. He followed
            the Apostle's advice and returned. Now, from this example, you
            attempt to derive a justification for "a member of a Church" to be
            engaged in forcibly apprehending and restoring fugitive slaves. I

            say forcibly&#8212;as the apprehension and return, referred to in the Resolution,
            are clearly forcible. I cannot refrain, sir, from saying,
            that you greatly wrong the memory of that blessed Apostle of the
            Lord Jesus, in construing his writings to authorize such violence
            upon the persons and rights of men. And greatly, also, do you
            wrong the Resolution in question, by your endeavor to array the
            Bible against it. The Resolution is right; it is noble&#8212;it denotes in
            the source whence it emanated, a proper sense of the rights and dignity
            of man. It is all the better for being marked with an honorable
            contempt of wicked and heaven-daring laws. May I, having the
            suspicion, or even the certain knowledge, that my fellow man was
            once held in slavery, and is still <em>legally</em> a slave, seize
            upon him and reduce him again to slavery? May I thus deal with a guiltless and
            unaccused brother? Human laws may, it is true, bear me out in
            this man-stealing, which is not less flagrant than that committed on
            the coast of Africa:&#8212;but, says the Great Law-giver, "The word
            that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day:"&#8212;and,
            it is a part of this "word," that "he that stealeth a man shall surely
            be put to death." In that last day, the mayors, recorders, sheriffs,
            and others, who have been engaged, whether in their official or individual
            capacity, in slave-catching and man-stealing, will find human
            laws but a flimsy protection against the wrath of Him, who judges his
            creatures by his own and not by human laws. In that "last day,"
            all who have had a part, and have not repented of it, in the sin of
            treating man as property; all, I say, whether slaveholders or their
            official or unofficial assistants, the drivers upon their plantations, or
            their drivers in the free States&#8212;all, who have been guilty of throwing
            God's "image" into the same class with the brutes of the field&#8212;will
            find, that He is the avenger of his poorest, meanest ones&#8212;and that
            the crime of transmuting His image into property, is but aggravated
            by the fact and the plea that it was committed under the sanction of
            human laws.

         </p>
         <p>
            But, to return&#8212;wherein does the letter of Paul to Philemon justify
            slaveholding? What evidence does it contain, that Philemon was a
            slaveholder at the time it was written? He, who had been his
            slave "in time past," had, very probably, escaped before Philemon's
            conversion to Christ. This "time past," may have been a
            <em>long</em> "time past." The word in the original, which is translated
            "in time past," does not forbid the supposition. Indeed, it is the same
            word, which the Apostle uses in the thirteenth verse of the first chapter
            of Galatians; and there it denotes a <em>long</em> "time past"&#8212;as much as

            from fifteen to eighteen years. Besides, Onesimus' escape and
            return both favor the supposition, that it was between the two events
            that Philemon's conversion took place. On the one hand, he fled to
            escape from the cruelties of an unconverted master; on the other,
            he was encouraged to follow the Apostle's advice, by the consideration,
            that on his return to Philemon he should not have to encounter
            again the unreasonableness and rage of a heathen, but that he should
            meet with the justice and tenderness of a Christian&#8212;qualities, with
            the existence and value of which, he had now come to an experimental
            acquaintance. Again, to show that the letter in question does
            not justify slaveholding&#8212;in what character was it, that Paul sent
            Onesimus to Philemon? Was it in that of a slave? Far from it.
            It was, in that of "a brother beloved," as is evident from his injunction
            to Philemon to "receive him forever&#8212;not now as a
            <i>slave</i>, but above a
            <i>slave</i>&#8212;a brother beloved."

         </p>
         <p>
            It is worthy of remark, that Paul's message to Philemon, shows,
            not only that he himself was not in favor of slaveholding, but, that he
            believed the gospel had wrought such an entire change on this subject,
            in the heart of Philemon, that Onesimus would find on his return
            to him, the tyrant and the slaveholder sunk in the brother and the
            Christian.

         </p>
         <p>
            Paul's course in relation to Onesimus was such, as an abolitionist
            would deem it proper to adopt, under the like circumstances. If a
            fugitive slave, who had become a dear child of God, were near me,
            and, if I knew that his once cruel master had also become a "dearly
            beloved" Christian; and if, therefore, I had reason to believe, as
            Paul had, in the case of Philemon, that he would "receive him forever&#8212;not
            now as a <i>slave</i>, but above a
            <i>slave</i>, a brother beloved," I
            would advise him to revisit his old master, provided he could do so,
            without interference and violence from others. Such interference
            and violence did not threaten Onesimus in his return to Philemon.
            He was not in danger of being taken up, imprisoned, and sold for his
            jail fees, as a returning Onesimus would be in parts of this nation.

            On the 72d page of your book, you utter sentiments, which, I trust,
            all your readers will agree, are unworthy of a man, a republican, and
            a Christian. You there endeavor again to make it appear, that it is
            not the <i>relation</i> of master and slave, but only
            the abuse of it, which is to be objected to.&#8212;You say: "Independence is
            a charming idea, especially to Americans: but what gives it the charm? Is it
            the thing in itself? or is it because it is a release from the control of a
            bad master? Had Great Britain been a kind master, our ancestors were

            willing to remain her slaves." In reply to this I would say, that it
            must be a base spirit which does not prize "independence" for its
            own sake, whatever privation and suffering may attend it; and
            much more base must be that spirit, which can exchange that "independence"
            for a state of slavish subjection&#8212;even though that state
            abound in all sensual gratifications. To talk of "a kind master" is
            to talk of a blessing for a dog, but not for a man, who is made to
            "call no man master." Were the people of this nation like yourself,
            they would soon exchange their blood-bought liberties for subjection
            to any despot who would promise them enough to eat, drink,
            and wear. But, I trust, that we at the North are "made of sterner
            stuff." They, who make slaves of others, can more easily become
            slaves themselves: for, in their aggressions upon others, they have
            despised and trampled under foot those great, eternal principles of
            right, which <em>not only</em> constitute the bulwark of the general
            freedom; but his respect for which is indispensable to every man's valuation
            and protection of his individual liberties. This train of thought associates
            with itself in my mind, the following passage in an admirable
            speech delivered by the celebrated William Pinckney, in the Maryland
            House of Delegates in 1789. Such a speech, made at the present
            time in a slave State, would probably cost the life of him who
            should make it; nor could it be delivered in a free States at any less
            sacrifice, certainly, than that of the reputation of the orator. What a
            retrograde movement has liberty made in this country in the last
            fifty years!

            "Whilst a majority of your citizens are accustomed to rule with
            the authority of despots, within particular limits&#8212;while your youths
            are reared in the habit of thinking that the great rights of human
            nature are not so sacred, but they may with innocence be trampled
            on, can it be expected, that the public mind should glow with that
            generous ardor in the cause of freedom, which can alone save a
            government, like ours, from the lurking demon of usurpation? Do
            you not dread the contamination of principle? Have you no alarms
            for the continuance of that spirit, which once conducted us to victory
            and independence, when the talons of power were unclasped for our
            destruction? Have you no apprehension left, that when the votaries
            of freedom sacrifice also at the gloomy altars of slavery, they will, at
            length, become apostates from them for ever? For my own part, I
            have no hope, that the stream of general liberty will flow for ever,
            unpolluted, through the foul mire of partial bondage, or that they, who

            have been habituated to lord it over others, will not be base enough,
            in time, to let others lord it over them. If they resist, it will be the
            struggle of <em>pride</em> and <em>selfishness</em>, not of
            <em>principle</em>."

            Had Edmund Burke known slaveholders as well as Mr. Pinckney
            knew them, he would not have pronounced his celebrated eulogium
            on their love of liberty;&#8212;he would not have ascribed to them any
            love of liberty, but the spurious kind which the other orator, impliedly,
            ascribes to them&#8212;that which "pride and selfishness" beget and foster.
            Genuine love of liberty, as Mr. Pinckney clearly saw, springs
            from "principle," and is found no where but in the hearts of those
            who respect the liberties and the rights of others.

            I had reason, in a former part of this communication, to charge
            some of the sentiments of Professor Hodge with being alike reproachful
            to the memory of our fathers, and pernicious to the cause of civil
            liberty. There are sentiments on the 72d page of your book, obnoxious
            to the like charge. If political "independence"&#8212;if a free
            government&#8212;be the poor thing&#8212;the illusive image of an American
            brain&#8212;which you sneeringly represent it, we owe little thanks to
            those who purchased it for us, even though they purchased it with
            their blood; and little pains need we take in that case to preserve it.
            When will the people of the Northern States see, that the doctrines
            now put forth so industriously to maintain slavery, are rapidly undermining
            liberty?

            On the 43d page of your book you also evince your low estimate
            of man's rights and dues. You there say, "the fact that the planters
            of Mississippi and Louisiana, even while they have to pay from
            twenty to twenty-five dollars per barrel for pork the present season,
            afford to their slaves from three to four and a half pounds per week,
            does not show, that they are neglectful in rendering to their slaves
            that which is just and equal." If men had only an animal, and not a
            spiritual and immortal nature also, it might do for you to represent
            them as well provided for, if but pork enough were flung to them.
            How preposterous to tell us, that God approves a system which
            brings a man, as slavery seems to have brought you, to regard his
            fellow man as a mere animal!

            I am happy to find that you are not all wrong. You are no
            "gradualist." You are not inconsistent, like those who admit that
            slavery is sinful, and yet refuse to treat it as sinful. I hope our
            Northern "gradualists" will profit by the following passage in your
            book: "If I were convinced by that word (the Bible) that slavery is
            itself a sin, I trust that, let it cost what it would, I should be an
            abolitionist,

            because there is no truth, more clear to my mind, than that
            the gospel requires an <em>immediate</em> abandonment of sin."

         <p>
            You have no doubt of your right to hold your fellow men, as
            slaves. I wish you had given your readers more fully your views of
            the origin of this right. I judge from what you say, that you trace
            it back to the curse pronounced by Noah upon Canaan. But was
            that curse to know no end? Were Canaan's posterity to endure the
            entailment of its disabilities and woes, until the end of time? Was
            Divine mercy never to stay the desolating waves of this curse? Was
            their harsh and angry roar to reach, even into the gospel dispensation,
            and to mingle discordantly with the songs of "peace on earth
            and good will to men?" Was the captivity of Canaan's race to be
            even stronger than He, who came "to bind up the broken-hearted,
            and proclaim liberty to the captives?" But who were Canaan and
            his descendants? You speak of them, and with singular unfairness,
            I think, as "<em>the</em> posterity of Ham, from whom, it is supposed,
            sprang the Africans." They were, it is true, a part of Ham's posterity; but
            to call them "<em>the</em> posterity of Ham," is to speak as though he
            had no other child than Canaan. The fifteenth to nineteenth verses of the
            tenth chapter of Genesis teach us, beyond all question, that Canaan's
            descendants inhabited the land of Canaan and adjacent territory,
            and that this land is identical with the country afterwards
            occupied by the Jews, and known, in modern times, by the name of
            Palestine, or the Holy Land. Therefore, however true it may be,
            that a portion of Ham's posterity settled in Africa, we not only have
            no evidence that it was the portion cursed, but we have conclusive
            evidence that it was not.

         </p>
         <p>
            But, was it a state of slavery to which Canaanites were doomed?
            I will suppose, for a moment, that it was: and, then, how does it
            appear right to enslave them? The curse in question is prophecy.
            Now prophecy does not say what ought to come to pass: nor does
            it say, that they who have an agency in the production of the foretold
            event, will be innocent in that agency. If the prediction of an event
            justifies those who are instrumental in producing it, then was Judas
            innocent in betraying our Saviour. "It must needs be that offences
            come, but wo to that man by whom the offence cometh." Prophecy
            simply tells what will come to pass. The question, whether it was
            proper to enslave Canaanites, depends for its solution not on the
            curse or prophecy in question. If the measure were in conformity
            with the general morality of the Bible, then it was proper. Was it in
            conformity with it? It was not. The justice, equity and mercy

            which were, agreeable to the Divine command, to characterize the
            dealings of the Jews with each other, are in such conformity, and
            these are all violated by slavery. If those dealings were all based on
            the general morality of the Bible, as they certainly were, then slavery,
            which, in its moral character, is completely opposite to them, cannot
            rest on that morality. If that morality did not permit the Jews to
            enslave Canaanites, how came they to enslave them? You will say,
            that they had special authority from God to do so, in the words,
            "Both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall
            be of the heathen that are around about you; of them shall ye buy
            bondmen and bondmaids." Well, I will admit that God did in one
            instance, and that He may have done so in others, give special authority
            to the Jews to do that, which, without such authority, would
            have been palpably and grossly immoral. He required them to
            exterminate some of the tribes of the Canaanites. He may have
            required them to bring other Heathens under a form of servitude
            violative of the general morality of his word.&#8212;Of course, no blame
            attaches to the execution of such commands. When He specially
            deputes us to kill for Him, we are as innocent in the agency, notwithstanding
            the general law, "thou shalt not kill," as is the earthquake
            or thunderbolt, when commissioned to destroy. Samuel was
            as innocent in hewing "Agag in pieces," as is the tree that falls
            upon the traveler. It may be remarked, in this connexion, that the
            fact that God gave a special statute to destroy some of the tribes of
            the Canaanites, argues the contrariety of the thing required to the
            morality of the Bible. It argues, that this morality would not have
            secured the accomplishment of what was required by the statute.
            Indeed, it is probable that it was, sometimes, under the influence of
            the tenderness and mercy inculcated by this morality, that the Jews
            were guilty of going counter to the special statute in question, and
            sparing the devoted Canaanites, as in the instance when they "spared
            Agag." We might reason, similarly to show that a special statute,
            if indeed there were such a one, authorizing the Jews to compel the
            Heathen to serve them, argues that compulsory service is contrary to
            fundamental morality. We will suppose that God did; in the special
            statute referred to, clothe the Jews with power to enslave Heathens,
            and now let me ask you, whether it is by this same statute to enslave,
            that you justify your neighbors and yourself for enslaving your fellow
            men? But this is a special statute, conferring a power on the Jews
            only&#8212;a power too, not to enslave whomsoever they could; but only
            a specified portion of the human family, and this portion, as we have

            seen, of a stock, other than that from which you have obtained your
            slaves. If the special statutes, by which God clothed the Jews with
            peculiar powers, may be construed to clothe you with similar powers,
            then, inasmuch as they were authorized and required to kill Canaanites,
            you may hunt up for destruction the straggling descendants of
            such of the devoted ones, as escaped the sword of the Jews. Or, to
            make a different interpretation of your rights, under this supposition;
            since the statute in question authorized and required the Jews to kill
            the heathen, within the borders of what was properly the Jews' country,
            then you are also authorized and required to kill the heathens
            within the limits of your country:&#8212;and these are not wanting, if the
            testimony of your ecclesiastical bodies, before referred to, can be
            relied on; and, if it be as they say, that the millions of the poor
            colored brethren in the midst of you are made heathens by the operation
            of the system, to which, with unparalleled wickedness, they are
            subjected.

         </p>
         <p>
            If then, neither Noah's curse, nor the special statute in question,
            authorize you to enslave your fellow men, there is, probably, but one
            ground on which you will contend for authority to do so&#8212;and this is
            the ground of the general morality of the Christian religion&#8212;of the
            general principles of right and duty, in the word of God. Do you
            find your authority on this ground? If you do, then, manifestly, you
            have a right to enslave me, and I a right to enslave you, and every
            man has a right to enslave whomsoever he can;&#8212;a right as perfect,
            as is the right to do good to one another. Indeed, the enslavement
            of each other would, under this construction of duty, <em>be</em> the
            doing of good to one another. Think you, sir, that the universal exercise of
            this right would promote the fulfilment of the "new commandment
            that ye love one another?" Think you, it would be the harbinger of
            millenial peace and blessedness? Or, think you not, rather, that it
            would fully and frightfully realize the prophet's declaration: "They
            all lie in wait for blood: they hunt every man his neighbor with a net."

         </p>
         <p>
            If any people have a right to enslave their fellow men, it must be
            the Jews, if they once had it. But if they ever had it, it ceased,
            when all their peculiar rights ceased. In respect to rights from the
            Most High, they are now on the same footing with other races of
            men. When "the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top
            to the bottom," then that distinction from the Gentile, in which the
            Jew had gloried, ceased, and the partition wall between them was
            prostrate for ever. The Jew, as well as the Gentile, was never more
            to depart from the general morality of the Bible. He was never

            again to be under any special statutes, whose requirements should
            bring him into collision with that morality: He was no more to confine
            his sympathies and friendships within the narrow range of the
            twelve tribes: but every son and daughter of Adam were thenceforth
            entitled to claim from him the heart and hand of a brother. "Under
            the glorious dispensation of the gospel," says the immortal Granville
            Sharp, "we are absolutely bound to consider ourselves as citizens of
            the world; every man whatever, without any partial distinction of
            nation, distance, or complexion, must necessarily be esteemed our
            neighbor and our brother; and we are absolutely bound, in Christian
            duty, to entertain a disposition towards all mankind, as charitable and
            benevolent, at least, as that which was required of the Jews under
            the law towards their brethren; and, consequently, it is absolutely
            unlawful for those who call themselves Christians, to exact of their
            brethren (I mean their brethren of the universe) a more burthensome
            service, than that to which the Jews were limited with respect to
            their brethren of the house of Israel; and the slavery or involuntary
            bondage of a brother Israelite was absolutely forbid."

         </p>
         <p>
            It occurs to me, that after all which has been said to satisfy you,
            that compulsory servitude, if such there were among the Jews, cannot
            properly be pleaded in justification of yours; a question may still be
            floating in your mind whether, if God directed his chosen people to
            enslave the Heathen, slavery should not be regarded as a good system
            of servitude? Just as pertinently may you ask, whether that is
            not a good system of servitude, which is found in some of our state
            prisons. Punishment probably&#8212;certainly not labor&#8212;is the leading
            object in the one case as well as the other: and the labor of the
            bondman in the one, as well as of the convict in the other, constitutes
            but a subordinate consideration. To suppose that God would,
            with every consideration out of view, but that of having the best relation
            of employer and laborer, make choice of slavery&#8212;to suppose
            that He believes that this state of servitude operates most beneficially,
            both for the master and the servant&#8212;is a high impeachment
            of the Divine wisdom and goodness. But thus guilty are you, if
            you are unwilling to believe, that, if He chose the severe servitude
            in question, He chose it for the punishment of his enemies, or from
            some consideration, other than its suitableness for the ordinary purposes
            of the relation of master and servant.

         </p>
         <p>
            But it has been for the sake of argument only, that I have admitted
            that God authorized the Jews to enslave the heathen. I now totally
            deny that He did so. You will, of course, consent that if He did

            so, it was in a special statute, as was the case when He authorized them
            to exterminate other heathen: and you will as readily
            consent that He enacted the statutes, in both instances, with the
            view of punishing his enemies. Now, in killing the Canaanites,
            the Jew was constituted, not the owner of his devoted fellow man,
            but simply the executioner of God's vengeance: and evidently, such
            and no other was his character when he was reducing the Canaanite
            to involuntary servitude&#8212;that he did so reduce him, and was commissioned
            by God to do so, is the supposition we make for the sake of
            argument. Had the Jews been authorized by God to shut up in dungeons for
            life those of the heathen, whom they were directed to have
            for bondmen and bondmaids, you would not claim, that they, any
            more than sheriffs and jailers in our day, are to be considered in the
            light of owners of the persons in their charge. Much less then, can
            the Jews be considered as the owners of any person whom they held
            in servitude: for, however severe the type of that servitude, the
            liberty of its subject was not restricted, as was that of the prisoners
            in question:&#8212;most certainly, the power asserted over him is not to
            be compared in extent with that asserted by the Jew over the Canaanite,
            whom he slew;&#8212;a case in which he was, indisputably, but
            the executioner of the Divine wrath. The Canaanite, whether devoted to a
            violent death or to an involuntary servitude, still remained
            the property of God: and God no more gave him up to be the property
            of the executioner of his wrath, than the people of the State of New
            York give up the offender against public justice to be the property of
            the ministers of that justice. God never suspends the accountability
            of his rational creatures to himself: and his rights to them, He never
            transfers to others. He could not do so consistently with his attributes,
            and his indissoluble relations to man. But slavery claims, that its
            subjects are the property of man. It claims to turn them into mere
            chattels, and to make them as void of responsibility to God, as other
            chattels. Slavery, in a word, claims to push from his throne the
            Supreme Being, who declares, "all souls are mine." That it does not
            succeed in getting its victim out of God's hand, and in unmanning and
            <i>chattelizing</i> him&#8212;that God's hold upon him
            remains unbroken, and that those upward tendencies of the soul, which
            distinguish man from the brute, are not yet entirely crushed in him&#8212;is no
            evidence in favor of its nature:&#8212;it simply proves, that its power is not
            equal to its purposes. We see, then, that the Jews&#8212;if it be true that they
            reduced their fellow men to involuntary servitude, and did so as the
            Heaven-appointed ministers of God's justice,&#8212;are not to be charged with

            slaveholding for it. There may be involuntary servitude where there
            is no slavery. The essential and distinguishing feature of slavery is
            its reduction of man to property&#8212;to a thing. A tenant of one of our
            state prisons is under a sentence of "hard labor for life." But he
            is not a slave. That is, he is not the <em>thing</em> which slavery would
            mark its subject. He is still a man. Offended justice has placed
            him in his present circumstances, because he is a man: and, it is
            because he is a <em>man</em> and not a <em>thing</em>&#8212;a responsible,
            and not an irresponsible being, that he must continue in his present trials
            and sufferings.

         </p>
         <p>
            God's commandments to the Jews, respecting servants and
            strangers, show that He not only did not authorize them to set up
            the claim of property in their fellow men, but that He most carefully
            guarded against such exercises of power, as might lead to the
            assumption of a claim so wrongful to Himself. Some of these commandments
            I will bring to your notice. They show that whatever
            was the form of servitude under which God allowed the Jews to hold
            the heathen, it was not slavery. Indeed, if all of the Word of God
            which bears on this point were cited and duly explained, it would,
            perhaps, appear that He allowed no involuntary servitude whatever
            amongst the Jews. I give no opinion whether he allowed it or not.
            There are strong arguments which go to show, that He did not allow
            it; and with these arguments the public will soon be made more
            extensively acquainted. It is understood, that the next number of
            the Anti-Slavery Examiner will be filled with them.

            1st. So galling are the bonds of Southern slavery, that it could
            not live a year under the operation of a law forbidding the restoration
            of fugitive servants to their masters. How few of the discontented
            subjects of this oppressive servitude would agree with Hamlet,
            that it is better to

         </p>
         <div class="lg">&#8212;"bear those ills we have,<br>Than fly to others that we know not of."<br><br></div>
         <p>
            What a running there would be from the slave States to the free!&#8212;from
            one slave State to another!&#8212;from one plantation to another!
            Now, such a law&#8212;a solemn commandment of God&#8212;many writers
            on slavery are of the opinion, perhaps too confident opinion, was in
            force in the Jewish nation (Deut. xxiii, 15); and yet the system of
            servitude on which it bore, and which you cite as the pattern and
            authority for your own, lived in spite of it. How could it? Manifestly,
            because its genius was wholly unlike that of Southern slavery;

            and because its rigors and wrongs, if rigors and wrongs there were
            in it, bear no comparison to those which characterize Southern
            slavery; and which would impel nine-tenths of its adult subjects to
            fly from their homes, did they but know that they would not be obliged
            to return to them. When Southern slaveholders shall cease to scour
            the land for fugitive servants, and to hunt them with guns and dogs,
            and to imprison, and scourge, and kill them;&#8212;when, in a word, they
            shall subject to the bearing of such a law as that referred to their
            system of servitude, then we shall begin to think that they are sincere
            in likening it to the systems which existed among the Jews. The
            law, enacted in Virginia in 1705, authorizing any two justices of the
            peace "by proclamation to <i>outlaw</i> runaways, who
            might thereafter be killed and destroyed by any person whatsoever, by such
            ways and means as he might think fit, without accusation or impeachment of
            any crime for so doing," besides that it justifies what I have just
            said about hunting fugitive servants, shows, 1st. That the American
            Anti-Slavery Society is of too recent an origin to be the occasion, as
            slaveholders and their apologists would have us believe, of all the
            cruel laws enacted at the South. 2d. That Southern slaveholders
            would be very unwilling to have their system come under the operation
            of such a law as that which allowed the Jewish servant to change
            his master. 3d. That they are monsters, indeed, into which men
            may be turned by their possession of absolute power.

         </p>
         <p>
            You, perhaps, suppose, (and I frankly admit to you, that there is
            some room for the supposition,) that the servants referred to in the
            15th and 16th verses of the 23d chapter of Deuteronomy, were such
            as had escaped from foreign countries to the country of the Jews.
            But, would this view of the matter help you? By taking it, would
            you not expose yourself to be most pertinently and embarrassingly
            asked, for what purpose these servants fled to a strange and most
            odious people?&#8212;and would not your candid reply necessarily be,
            that it was to escape from the galling chains of slavery, to a far-famed
            milder type of servitude?&#8212;from Gentile oppression, to a land in which
            human rights were protected by Divine laws? But, as I have previously
            intimated, I have not the strongest confidence in the anti-slavery
            argument, so frequently drawn from this passage of the Bible.
            I am not sure that a Jewish servant is referred to: nor that on the
            supposition of his being a foreigner, the servant came under any form
            of servitude when entering the land of the Jews. Before leaving
            the topic, however, let me remark, that the passage, under any construction
            of it, makes against Southern slavery. Admit that the

            fugitive servant was a foreigner, and that he was not reduced to servitude
            on coming among the Jews, let me ask you whether the law in
            question, under this view of it, would be tolerated by the spirit of
            Southern slavery?&#8212;and whether, before obedience would be rendered
            to it, you would not need to have a different type of servitude, in the
            place of slavery? You would&#8212;I know you would&#8212;for you have
            been put to the trial. When, by a happy providence, a vessel was
            driven, the last year, to a West India island, and the chains of the
            poor slaves with which it was filled fell from around them, under
            freedom's magic power, the exasperated South was ready to go to
            war with Great Britain. <em>Then</em>, the law against delivering up
            foreign servants to their masters was not relished by you. The given case
            comes most strikingly within the supposed policy of this law. The
            Gentile was to be permitted to remain in the land to which he had
            fled, and where he would have advantages for becoming acquainted
            with the God of the Bible. Such advantages are they enjoying who
            escaped from the confessed heathenism of Southern slavery to the
            island in question. They are now taught to read that "Book of life,"
            which before, they were forbidden to read. But again, suppose a
            slave were to escape from a West India island into the Southern
            States&#8212;would you, with your "domestic institutions," of which you
            are so jealous, render obedience to this Divine law? No; you would
            subject him <em>for ever</em> to a servitude more severe than that, from
            which he had escaped. Indeed, if a <i>freeman</i> come
            within a certain portion of our Southern country, and be so unhappy as to
            bear a physical resemblance to the slave, he will be punished for that
            resemblance, by imprisonment, and even by a reduction to slavery.

         </p>
         <p>
            2d. Southern slaveholders, who, by their laws, own men as absolutely
            as they own cattle, would have it believed, that Jewish masters
            thus owned their fellow-men. If they did, why was there so wide a
            difference between the commandment respecting the stray man, and
            that respecting the stray ox or ass? The man was not, but the beasts
            were, to be returned; and that too, even though their owner was the
            enemy of him who met them. (Ex. 23. 4.) I repeat the question;&#8212;why
            this difference? The only answer is, because God made the
            brute to be the <i>property</i> of man; but He never
            gave us our noble nature for such degradation. Man's title deed, in the
            eighth Psalm, extends his right of property to the inanimate and brute
            creation only&#8212;not to the flesh and bones and spirit of his fellow-man.

         </p>
         <p>
            3d. The very different penalties annexed to the crime of stealing
            a man, and to that of stealing a thing, shows the eternal and infinite

            difference which God has established between a man and property.
            The stealing of a man was <em>surely</em> to be punished with death;
            whilst mere property was allowed to atone for the offence of stealing
            property.

         </p>
         <p>
            4th. Who, if not the slave, can be said to be vexed and oppressed!
            But God's command to his people was, that they should neither "vex
            a stranger, nor oppress him."

         </p>
         <p>
            5th. Such is the nature of American slavery, that not even its
            warmest friends would claim that it could recover itself after such a
            "year of jubilee" as God appointed. One such general delivery of
            its victims would be for ever fatal to it. I am aware that you deny
            that all the servants of the Jews shared in the blessings of the "year
            of jubilee." But let me ask you, whether if one third or one half
            of your servants were discharged from servitude every fiftieth year&#8212;and
            still more, whether if a considerable proportion of them were
            thus discharged every sixth year&#8212;the remainder would not be fearfully
            discontented? Southern masters believe, that their only safety
            consists in keeping down the discontent of their servants. Hence
            their anxious care to withhold from them the knowledge of human
            rights. Hence the abolitionist who is caught in a slave state, must
            be whipped or put to death. If there were a class of servants
            amongst the Jews, who could bear to see all their fellow servants go
            free, whilst they themselves were retained in bondage, then that
            bondage was of a kind very different from what you suppose it to
            have been. Had its subjects worn the galling chains of American
            slavery, they would have struggled with bloody desperation for the
            deliverance which they saw accorded to others.

         </p>
         <p>
            I scarcely need say, that the Hebrew words rendered "bondmen"
            and "bondmaids," do not, in themselves considered, and independently
            of the connexion in which they are used, any more than the
            Greek words <i>doulos</i> and
            <i>doule</i>, denote a particular
            kind of servant. If the servant was a slave, because he was called by the
            Hebrew word rendered "bondman," then was Jacob a slave also:&#8212;and even
            still greater absurdities could be deduced from the position.

         </p>
         <p>
            I promised, in a former part of this communication, to give you my
            reasons for denying that you are at liberty to plead in behalf of
            slavery, the example of any compulsory servitude in which Jews
            may have held foreigners. My promise is now fulfilled, and I trust
            that the reasons are such as not to admit of an answer.

         </p>
         <p>
            Driven, as you now are, from every other conceivable defence of
            slaveholding it may be (though I must hope better things of you),

            that you will fly to the ground taken by the wicked multitude&#8212;that
            there is authority in the laws of man for being a slaveholder. But,
            not only is the sin of your holding slaves undiminished by the consideration,
            that they are held under human laws; but, your claiming
            to hold them under such laws, makes you guilty of an additional sin,
            which, if measured by its pernicious consequences to others, is by no
            means inconsiderable. The truth of these two positions is apparent
            from the following considerations.

         </p>
         <p>
            1st. There is no valid excuse to be found, either in man's laws or
            any where else, for transgressing God's laws. Whatever may be
            thought, or said to the contrary, it still remains, and for ever will
            remain true, that under all circumstances, "sin is the transgression
            of the (Divine) law."

         </p>
         <p>
            2d. In every instance in which a commandment of God is transgressed,
            under the cover and plea of a human law, purporting to permit
            what that commandment forbids, there is, in proportion to the
            authority and influence of the transgressor, a fresh sanction imparted
            to that law; and consequently, in the same proportion the public
            habit of setting up a false standard of right and wrong is promoted.
            It is this habit&#8212;this habit of graduating our morality by the laws of
            the land in which we live&#8212;that makes the "mischief framed by a
            law" so much more pernicious than that which has no law to countenance
            it, and to commend it to the conscience. Who is unaware,
            that nothing tends so powerfully to keep the traffic in strong drink
            from becoming universally odious, as the fact, that this body and soul
            destroying business finds a sanction in human laws? Who has not
            seen the man, authorized by these laws to distribute the poison
            amongst his tippling neighbors, proof against all the shafts of truth,
            under the self-pleasing and self-satisfying consideration, that his is
            a lawful business.

         </p>
         <p>
            This habit of setting up man's law, instead of God's law, as the
            standard of conduct, is strikingly manifested in the fact, that on the
            ground, that the Federal Constitution binds the citizens of the United
            States to perpetuate slavery, or at least, not to meddle with it, we
            are, both at the North and the South, called on to forbear from all
            efforts to abolish it. The exertions made to discover in that instrument,
            authority for slavery, and authority against endeavors to abolish
            it, are as great, anxious, and unwearied, as if they who made them,
            thought that the fortunate discovery would settle for ever the great
            question which agitates our country&#8212;would nullify all the laws of
            God against slavery&#8212;and make the oppression of our colored brethren,

            as long as time shall last, justifiable and praiseworthy. But
            this discovery will never be made; for the Constitution is not on the
            side of the slaveholder. If it were, however, it would clothe him
            with no moral right to act in opposition to the paramount law of
            God. It is not at all necessary to the support of my views, in this
            communication, to show that the Constitution was not designed to
            favor slavery; and yet, a few words to this end may not be out of
            place.

         </p>
         <p>
            A treaty between Great Britain and Turkey, by the terms of which
            the latter should be prohibited from allowing slaves to be brought
            within her dominions, after twenty years from its date, would, all will
            admit, redound greatly to the credit of Great Britain. To be sure, she
            would not have done as much for the cause of humanity, as if she
            had succeeded in bringing the further indulgence of the sin within the
            limits of a briefer period, and incomparably less than if she had succeeded
            in reconciling the Sublime Porte to her glorious and emphatically
            English doctrines of immediate emancipation. But still she
            would deserve some praise&#8212;much more than if she had done nothing
            in this respect. Now, for my present purpose, and many of our
            statesmen say, for nearly all purposes, the Federal Constitution is to
            be regarded as a treaty between sovereign States. But how much
            more does this treaty do for the abolition of slavery, than that on
            which we were, a moment since, bestowing our praise! It imposes
            a prohibition similar to that in the supposed treaty between Great
            Britain and Turkey, so that no slaves have been allowed to be introduced
            into the United States since the year 1808. It goes further,
            and makes ample provision for the abolition and prevention of slavery
            in every part of the nation, save these States; so that the District of
            Columbia and the national territories can be cleared forever of slavery,
            whenever a majority of the parties, bound by the treaty, shall desire
            it. And it goes still farther, and clothes this majority with the power
            of regulating commerce between the States, and consequently, of prohibiting
            their mutual traffic in "the bodies and souls of men." Had
            this treaty gone but one step farther, and made an exception, as it
            should have done, in behalf of slaves, in the clause making necessary
            provision for the return of fugitives held to service in the States from
            which they flee, none but those who think it is fairly held responsible
            for the twenty years indulgence of the unholy traffic, would have
            claimed any thing more from it in relation to slavery. Now, this instrument,
            which contains nothing more, bearing on the subject of
            slavery, than what I have referred to, and whose pages are not once

            polluted with the words "slave" and "slavery," is abundantly and
            triumphantly cited, as conclusive authority in favor of slavery, and
            against endeavors to abolish it. Whilst we regret, that the true-hearted
            sons of freedom in the Convention which formed it, could
            obtain no more concessions from the advocates of slavery, let us
            honor their sacred memory, and thank God for those they did obtain.

            I have supposed it possible, that you might number yourself with
            those, who defend slavery on the ground of its alleged conformity
            with human laws. It occurs to me, that you may, also, take hope,
            that slavery is defensible in the supposed fact, that a considerable
            share of the professing Christians, in the free States, are in favor of
            it. "Let God be true, but every man a liar." If all professing
            Christians were for slavery, yet, if God is against it, that is reason
            enough why you also should be against it. It is not true, however,
            that a considerable share of our professing Christians are on the
            side of slavery. Indeed, until I read Professor Hodge's article, I
            had not supposed that any of them denied its sinfulness. It is true,
            that a large proportion of them refuse to take a stand against it. Let
            them justify to their consciences, and to their God, as they can, the
            equivocal silence and still more equivocal action on this subject, by
            which they have left their Southern brethren to infer, that Northern
            piety sanctions slavery. It is the doctrine of expediency, so prevalent
            and corrupting in the American Church, which has deceived you
            into the belief, that a large share of the professing Christians in the
            free States, think slavery to be sinless. This share, which you have
            in your eye, is, as well as the remainder, convinced that slavery is
            sinful&#8212;<em>only they think it inexpedient to say so</em>. In relation to
            other sins, they are satisfied with God's way of immediate abandonment.
            But, in relation to slavery, they flatter themselves that they have discovered
            "a more excellent way"&#8212;that of leaving the sin untouched,
            and simply hoping for its cessation, at some indefinite period in the
            distant future. I say hoping, instead of praying, as prayer for an
            object is found to be accompanied by corresponding efforts. But
            for this vile doctrine of expediency, which gives to our ecclesiastical
            bodies, whenever the subject of such a giant and popular sin as
            slavery is broached in them, the complexion of a political caucus
            steeped in unprincipled policy, rather than that of a company of the
            Saviour's disciples, inquiring "in simplicity and godly sincerity, not
            with fleshly wisdom," the way of the Lord;&#8212;but for this doctrine,
            I say, you would, long ago, have heard the testimony of Northern
            Christians against Southern slavery;&#8212;and not only so, but you would

            long ago have seen this Dagon fall before the power of that testimony.
            I trust, however, that this testimony will not long be withheld;
            and that Northern Christians will soon perceive, that, in relation to
            slavery, as well as every other sin, it is the safest and wisest, as well
            as the holiest course, to drop all carnal policy&#8212;to "trust in the Lord
            with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding."

         </p>
         <p>
            Not only are Northern Christians, with very rare exceptions, convinced
            of the sin of slavery; but even your slaveholders were formerly
            accustomed, with nearly as great unanimity, to admit, that they
            themselves thought it to be sinful. It is only recently, and since they
            have found that their system must be tested by the Bible, thoroughly
            and in earnest&#8212;not merely for the purpose, as formerly, of determining
            without any practical consequences of the determination, what
            is the moral character of slavery&#8212;but, for the purpose of settling the
            point, whether the institution shall stand or fall,&#8212;it is only, I say,
            since the civilized world has been fast coming to claim that it shall
            be decided by the Bible, and by no lower standard, whether slavery
            shall or shall not exist&#8212;that your slaveholders have found it expedient
            to take the ground, that slavery is not sin.

         </p>
         <p>
            It probably has not occurred to you, how fairly and fully you might
            have been stopped, upon the very threshold of your defence of slavery.
            The only witness you have called to the stand to sustain your sinking
            cause, is the Bible. But this is a witness, which slavery has itself
            impeached, and of which, therefore, it is not entitled to avail itself.
            It is a good rule in our civil courts, that a party is not permitted to
            impeach his own witness; and it is but an inconsiderable variation of
            the letter of this rule, and obviously no violation of its spirit and
            policy to say, that no party is permitted to attempt to benefit his
            cause by a witness whom he has himself impeached. Now, the
            slaveholder palpably violates this rule, when he presumes to offer the
            Bible as a witness for his cause:&#8212;for he has previously impeached
            it, by declaring, in his slave system, that it is not to be believed&#8212;that
            its requirements are not to be obeyed&#8212;that they are not even
            to be read (though the Bible expressly directs that they shall be)&#8212;that
            concubinage shall be substituted for the marriage it enjoins&#8212;and
            that its other provisions for the happiness, and even the existence, of
            the social relations, shall be trampled under foot. The scene, in
            which a lawyer should ask the jury to believe what his witness is
            saying at one moment, and to reject what he is saying at another,
            would be ludicrous enough. But what more absurdity is there in it
            than that which the pro-slavery party are guilty of, when they would

            have us deaf, whilst their witness is testifying in favor of marriage
            and searching the Scriptures; and, all ears, whilst that same witness
            is testifying, as they construe it, in favor of slavery! No&#8212;before it
            will be competent for the American slaveholder to appeal to the Bible
            for justification of his system, that system must be so modified, as no
            longer to make open, shameless war upon the Bible. I would recommend
            to slaveholders, that, rather than make so unhallowed a use of
            the Bible as to attempt to bolster up their hard beset cause with it,
            they should take the ground, which a very distinguished slaveholding
            gentleman of the city of Washington took, in a conversation with myself
            on the subject of slavery. Feeling himself uncomfortably plied
            by quotations from the word of God, he said with much emphasis,
            "Stop, Sir, with that, if you please&#8212;SLAVERY IS A SUBJECT, WHICH
            HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIBLE."

         </p>
         <p>
            This practice of attempting to put the boldest and most flagrant
            sins under the wing and sanction of the Bible, is chargeable on others
            as well as on the advocates of slavery. Not to speak of other instances
            of it&#8212;it is sought to justify by this blessed book the most
            despotic forms of civil government, and the drinking of intoxicating
            liquors. There are two evils so great, which arise from this perversion
            of the word of God, that I cannot forbear to notice them. One
            is, that the consciences of men are quieted, when they imagine that
            they have found a justification in the Bible for the sins of which they
            are guilty. The other is, that infidels are multiplied by this perversion.
            A respectable gentleman, who edits a newspaper in this neighborhood,
            and who, unhappily, is not established in the Christian faith,
            was asked, a few months since, to attend a meeting of a Bible Society.
            "I am not willing," said he, in reply, "to favor the circulation
            of a volume, which many of its friends claim to be on the side of
            slavery." Rely on it, Sir, that wherever your book produces the
            conviction that the Bible justifies slavery, it there weakens whatever
            of respect for that blessed volume previously existed. Whoever is
            brought to associate slavery with the Bible, may, it is true, think better
            of slavery; but he will surely think worse of the Bible. I hope,
            therefore, in mercy to yourself and the world, that the success of your
            undertaking will be small.

         </p>
         <p>
            But oftentimes the same providence has a bright, as well as a
            gloomy, aspect. It is so in the case before us. The common attempt,
            in our day, to intrench great sins in the authority of the Bible,
            is a consoling and cheering evidence, that this volume is recognised
            as the public standard of right and wrong; and that, whatever may

            be their private opinions of it who are guilty of these sins, they cannot
            hope to justify themselves before the world, unless their lives are,
            apparently, at least, conformed, in some good degree, to this standard.
            We may add, too, that, as surely as the Bible is against slavery, every
            pro-slavery writer, who like yourself appeals to it as the infallible and
            only admissible standard of right and wrong, will contribute to the
            overthrow of the iniquitous system. His writings may not, uniformly,
            tend to this happy result. In some instances, he may strengthen
            confidence in the system of slavery by producing conviction, that the
            Bible sanctions it;&#8212;and then his success will be, as before remarked,
            at the expense of the claims and authority of the Bible:&#8212;but these
            instances of the pernicious effects of his writings will be very rare,
            quite too rare we may hope, to counterbalance the more generally
            useful tendency of writings on the subject of slavery, which recognise
            the paramount authority of God's law.

         </p>
         <p>
            Having completed the examination of your book, I wish to hold up
            to you, in a single view, the substance of what you have done. You
            have come forth, the unblushing advocate of American slavery;&#8212;a
            system which, whether we study its nature in the deliberate and horrid
            enactments of its code, or in the heathenism and pollution and
            sweat and tears and blood, which prove, but too well, the agreement
            of its practical character with its theory&#8212;is, beyond all doubt, more
            oppressive and wicked than any other, which the avaricious, sensual,
            cruel heart of man ever devised. You have come forth, the unblushing
            advocate of a system under which parents are daily selling their
            children; brothers and sisters, their brothers and sisters; members
            of the Church of Christ, their fellow-members&#8212;under which, in a
            word, immortal man, made "in the image of God," is more unfeelingly
            and cruelly dealt with, than the brute. I know that you intimate
            that this system would work well, were it in the hands of none but
            good men. But with equal propriety might you say, that the gaming-house
            or the brothel would work well in such hands. You have attempted
            to sustain this system by the testimony of the Bible. The
            system, a part only of the crimes of which, most of the nations of
            Christendom have declared to be piracy;&#8212;against which, the common
            sense, the philosophy, the humanity, the conscience of the world, are
            arrayed;&#8212;this system, so execrable and infamous, you have had the
            presumption to attempt to vindicate by that blessed book, whose Author
            "is of purer eyes than to behold evil, and (who) cannot look
            upon iniquity"&#8212;and who "has magnified his word above all his
            name."

         </p>
         <p>
            And now, Sir, let me solemnly inquire of you, whether it is right to
            do what you have done?&#8212;whether it is befitting a man, a Christian,
            and a minister of the gospel?&#8212;and let me, further, ask you, whether
            you have any cheering testimony in your heart that it is God's work
            you have been doing? That you and I may, in every future work
            of our hands, have the happiness to know, that the approbation of
            our employer comes from the upper, and not from the under world,
            is the sincere desire of
            <br><br></p>

            The spirit of slavery never takes refuge in the Bible <em>of its own
               accord.</em> The horns of the altar are its last resort. It seizes them,
            if at all, only in desperation&#8212;rushing from the terror of the avenger's arm.
            Like other unclean spirits, it "hateth the light, neither cometh to the
            light, lest its deeds should be reproved." Goaded to phrenzy in its
            conflicts with conscience and common sense, denied all quarter, and
            hunted from every covert, it breaks at last into the sacred enclosure,
            and courses up and down the Bible, "seeking rest, and finding none."
            THE LAW OF LOVE, streaming from every page, flashes around it an
            omnipresent anguish and despair. It shrinks from the hated light, and
            howls under the consuming touch, as demons recoiled from the Son of
            God, and shrieked, "Torment us not." At last, it slinks away among
            the shadows of the Mosaic system, and thinks to burrow out of sight
            among its types and shadows. Vain hope! Its asylum is its sepulchre;
            its city of refuge, the city of destruction. It rushes from light into the
            sun; from heat, into devouring fire; and from the voice of God into
            the thickest of His thunders.

            <h3><a name="E4_def"></a>DEFINITION OF SLAVERY.
            </h3>
            <p>
               If we would know whether the Bible is the charter of slavery, we
               must first determine <em>just what slavery is</em>. The thing itself
               must be separated from its appendages. A constituent element is one thing;
               a relation another; an appendage another. Relations and appendages presuppose
               <em>other</em> things, of which there are relations and appendages. To
               regard them as <em>the things</em> to which they pertain, or as
               constituent parts of them, leads to endless fallacies. A great variety of
               conditions, relations, and tenures, indispensable to the social state, are
               confounded with slavery; and thus slaveholding is deemed quite harmless, if
               not virtuous. We will specify some of the things which are often
               confounded with slavery.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. <em>Privation of the right of suffrage</em>. Then <em>minors</em>
               are slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. <em>Ineligibility to office</em>. Then <em>females</em> are
               slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               3. <em>Taxation without representation</em>. Then three-fourths of
               the people of Rhode Island are slaves, and <em>all</em> in the District
               of Columbia.

            </p>
            <p>
               4. <em>Privation of one's oath in law</em>. Then the <em>free</em>
               colored people of Ohio are slaves. So are disbelievers in a future
               retribution, generally.

            </p>
            <p>
               5. <em>Privation of trial by jury</em>. Then all in France and Germany are
               slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               6. <em>Being required to support a particular religion</em>. Then the
               people of England are slaves. [To the preceding may be added all other
               disabilities, merely political.]

            </p>
            <p>
               7. <em>Cruelty and oppression</em>. Wives are often cruelly treated;
               hired domestics are often oppressed; but these forms of oppression are not
               slavery.

            </p>
            <p>
               8. <em>Apprenticeship</em>. The rights and duties of master and
               apprentice are correlative and reciprocal. The <em>claim</em> of each
               upon the other results from the <em>obligation</em> of each to the other.
               Apprenticeship is based on the principle of equivalent for value received.
               The rights of the apprentice are secured, and his interests are promoted
               equally with those of the master. Indeed, while the law of apprenticeship
               is <em>just</em> to the master, it is <em>benevolent</em> to the
               apprentice. Its main design is rather to benefit the apprentice than the
               master. It <em>promotes</em> the interests of the former, while it
               guards from injury those of the latter in doing it. It secures to the
               master a mere legal compensation, while it secures to the apprentice both
               a legal compensation, and a virtual gratuity in addition, the apprentice
               being of the two decidedly the greatest gainer. The law not only
               recognizes the <em>right</em> of the apprentice to a reward for his
               labor, but appoints the wages, and enforces the payment.
               The master's claim covers only the <em>services</em> of the apprentice.
               The apprentice's claim covers <em>equally</em> the services of the master.
               The master cannot hold the apprentice as property, nor the apprentice the
               master; but each holds property in the services of the other, and BOTH
               EQUALLY. Is this slavery?

            </p>
            <p>
               9. <em>Filial subordination and parental claims</em>. Both are nature's
               dictates, and indispensable to the existence of the social state; their
               <em>design</em> the promotion of mutual welfare; and the
               <em>means</em>, those natural affections created by the relation of parent
               and child, and blending them in one by irrepressible affinities; and thus,
               while exciting each to discharge those offices incidental to the relation,
               they constitute a shield for mutual protection. The parent's legal claim to
               the services of his children, while minors, is a slight boon for the care and
               toil of their rearing, to

               say nothing of outlays for support and education. This provision for
               the good of the <em>whole</em>, is, with the greater part of mankind,
               indispensable to the preservation of the family state. The child, in helping
               his parents, helps himself&#8212;increases a common stock, in which he has a
               share; while his most faithful services do but acknowledge a debt that
               money cannot cancel.

            </p>
            <p>
               10. <em>Bondage for crime, or governmental claims on criminals.</em> Must
               innocence be punished because guilt suffers penalties? True, the criminal
               works for the government without pay; and well he may. He
               owes the government. A century's work would not pay its drafts on
               him. He is a public defaulter, and will die so. Because laws make
               men pay their debts, shall those be forced to pay who
               <em>owe nothing?</em> Besides, the law makes no criminal, PROPERTY. It
               restrains his liberty; it makes him pay something, a mere penny in the pound,
               of his debt to the government; but it does not make him a
               <i>chattel</i>. Test it. To own property is to own its
               product. Are children born of convicts government property? Besides, can
               <em>property</em> be <em>guilty</em>? Are
               <i>chattels</i> punished?

            </p>
            <p>
               11. <em>Restrictions upon freedom.</em> Children are restrained by
               parents, wards by guardians, pupils by teachers, patients by physicians and
               nurses, corporations by charters, and legislators by constitutions. Embargoes,
               tariffs, quarantine, and all other laws, keep men from doing as
               they please. Restraints are the web of civilized society, warp and woof.
               Are they slavery? then civilized society is a mammoth slave&#8212;a government
               of LAW, <em>the climax of slavery</em>, and its executive a king among
               slaveholders.

            </p>
            <p>
               12. <em>Involuntary or compulsory service</em>. A juryman is empannelled
               <em>against his will</em>, and sit he <em>must</em>. A sheriff orders
               his posse; bystanders <em>must</em> turn in. Men are
               <em>compelled</em> to remove nuisances, pay fines and taxes, support
               their families, and "turn to the right as the law directs,"
               however much <em>against their wills</em>. Are they therefore slaves? To
               confound slavery with involuntary service is absurd. Slavery is a
               <i>condition</i>. The slave's <em>feelings</em>
               toward it, are one thing; the condition itself, the object of these feelings,
               is <em>another</em> thing; his feelings cannot alter the nature of that
               condition. Whether he <em>desire</em> or <em>detest</em> it, the
               <i>condition</i> remains the same. The slave's
               <em>willingness</em> to be a slave is no palliation of his master's
               guilt in holding him. Suppose the slave verily thinks himself a chattel, and
               consents that others may so regard him, does that <em>make</em> him a
               chattel, or make those guiltless who <em>hold</em> him as
               such? I may be sick of life, and I tell the assassin so that stabs me; is

               he any the less a murderer because I <em>consent</em> to be made a corpse?
               Does my partnership in his guilt blot out his part of it? If the slave
               were willing to be a slave, his <i>voluntariness</i>, so
               far from <em>lessening</em> the guilt of the "owner,"
               <em>aggravates</em> it. If slavery has so palsied his mind
               and he looks upon himself as a chattel, and consents to be one, actually
               <em>to hold him as such</em>, falls in with his delusion, and confirms
               the impious falsehood. <em>These very feelings and convictions of the
                  slave</em>, (if such were possible) increase a hundred fold the guilt of
               the master in holding him as property, and call upon him in thunder,
               immediately to recognize him as a MAN, and thus break the sorcery that binds
               his soul, cheating it of its birth-right, and the consciousness of its worth
               and destiny.

            </p>
            <p>
               Many of the foregoing conditions and relations are
               <i>appendages</i> of slavery, and some of them inseparable
               from it. But no one, nor all of them together, constitute its
               <i>intrinsic unchanging element</i>.

            </p>
            <p>
               We proceed to state affirmatively that,

            </p>
            <p>
               ENSLAVING MEN IS REDUCING THEM TO ARTICLES OF PROPERTY, making
               free agents chattels, converting <i>persons</i> into
               <i>things</i>, sinking intelligence,
               accountability, immortality, into <i>merchandise</i>. A
               <i>slave</i> is one held in this condition. He is a mere
               tool for another's use and benefit. In law "he owns nothing, and can acquire
               nothing." <em>His right to himself is abrogated.</em> He is
               another's property. If he say <em>my</em> hands, <em>my</em> feet,
               <em>my</em> body, <em>my</em> mind, MY<em>self</em>; they are
               figures of speech. To <em>use himself</em> for his own good is a CRIME.
               To keep what he <em>earns</em> is stealing. To take his body into his
               own keeping is <i>insurrection</i>. In a word, the&gt;
               <i>profit</i> of his master is the END of his being, and
               he, a <i>mere means</i> to that end,
               a <i>mere means</i> to an end into which his interests
               do not enter, of which they constitute no
               portion<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN1"></a>. MAN sunk to a <em>thing</em>! the
               intrinsic element, the <em>principle</em> of slavery; MEN sold, bartered,
               leased, mortgaged, bequeathed, invoiced, shipped in cargoes, stored as goods,
               taken on executions, and knocked off at public outcry! Their
               <i>rights</i> another's conveniences,

               their interests, wares on sale, their happiness, a household
               utensil; their personal inalienable ownership, a serviceable article, or
               plaything, as best suits the humor of the hour; their deathless nature,
               conscience, social affections, sympathies, hopes, marketable commodities!
               We repeat it, <em>the reduction of persons to things</em>; not robbing a
               man of privileges, but of <em>himself</em>; not loading with burdens, but
               making him a <em>beast of burden</em>; not <em>restraining</em>
               liberty, but subverting it; not curtailing rights, but abolishing them; not
               inflicting personal cruelty, but annihilating <em>personality</em>; not
               exacting involuntary labor, but sinking him into an <em>implement</em> of
               labor; not abridging his human comforts, but abrogating his
               <i>human nature</i>; not depriving an animal of
               immunities, but <em>despoiling a rational being of attributes</em>,
               uncreating a MAN to make room for a <em>thing</em>!

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN1"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN1">A</a>: Whatever system sinks man from an END to a
               <em>means</em>, or in other words, whatever transforms
               him from an object of instrumentality into a mere instrumentality
               <em>to</em> an object, just so far makes him a <em>slave</em>. Hence
               West India apprenticeship retains in <em>one</em> particular the cardinal
               principle of slavery. The apprentice, during three-fourths of his time, is
               still forced to labor, and robbed of his earnings; just so far forth he is a
               <em>mere means</em>, a <em>slave</em>. True, in all
               other respects slavery is abolished in the British West Indies. Its bloodiest
               features are blotted out&#8212;but the meanest and most despicable of all&#8212;forcing
               the poor to work for the rich without pay three-fourths of their time, with a
               legal officer to flog them if they demur at the outrage, is one of the
               provisions of the "Emancipation Act!" For the glories of that luminary,
               abolitionists thank God, while they mourn that it rose behind clouds, and
               shines through an eclipse.
            </p>
            <p>
               That this is American slavery, is shown by the laws of slave states.
               Judge Stroud, in his "Sketch of the Laws relating to Slavery," says,
               "The cardinal principle of slavery, that the slave is not to be ranked
               among sentient beings, but among <i>things</i>&#8212;is an
               article of property, a chattel personal, obtains as undoubted law in all of
               these states," (the slave states.) The law of South Carolina thus lays down
               the principle, "Slaves shall be deemed, held, taken, reputed, and adjudged in
               law to be <i>chattels personal</i> in the hands of their
               owners and possessors, and their executors, administrators, and assigns, to
               ALL INTENTS, CONSTRUCTIONS, AND PURPOSES WHATSOEVER." Brevard's Digest, 229.
               In Louisiana, "a slave is one who is in the power of a master to whom he
               <i>belongs</i>; the master may sell him, dispose of his
               <em>person, his industry, and his labor</em>; he can do nothing, possess
               nothing, nor acquire any thing, but what must belong to his master." Civil
               Code of Louisiana, Art. 35.

            </p>
            <p>
               This is American slavery. The eternal distinction between a person and a
               thing, trampled under foot&#8212;the crowning distinction of all others&#8212;their
               centre and circumference&#8212;the source, the test, and the measure of
               their value&#8212;the rational, immortal principle, embalmed by God in everlasting
               remembrance, consecrated to universal homage in a baptism of
               glory and honor, by the gift of His Son, His Spirit, His Word, His
               presence, providence, and power; His protecting shield, upholding staff,
               and sheltering wing; His opening heavens, and angels ministering, and

               proclaiming eternal sanctions, and confirming the word with signs

            </p>
            <p>
               Having stated the <em>principle</em> of American slavery, we ask,

               DOES THE BIBLE SANCTION SUCH A PRINCIPLE?[A]<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN2"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN2"></a>? To the <em>law</em> and the <em>testimony</em>. First,
               the moral law, or the ten commandments. Just after
               the Israelites were emancipated from their bondage in Egypt, while they
               stood before Sinai to receive the law, as the trumpet waxed louder, and
               the mount quaked and blazed, God spake the ten commandments from
               the midst of clouds and thunderings. <em>Two</em> of those commandments
               deal death to slavery. Look at the eighth, "<em>Thou shall not
                  steal</em>," or, thou shalt not take from another what belongs to him. All
               man's powers of body and mind are God's gift to <em>him</em>. That they
               are <em>his own</em>, and that he has a right to them, is proved from the
               fact that God has given them to <em>him alone</em>, that each of them is
               a part of <em>himself</em>, and all of them together
               <em>constitute</em> himself. All <em>else</em> that belongs to man is
               acquired by the <em>use</em> of these powers. The <em>interest</em>
               belongs to him, because the <em>principal</em> does&#8212;the product is his,
               because he is the <em>producer</em>. Ownership of any thing is ownership
               of its <em>use</em>. The right to use according to will, is
               <em>itself</em> ownership. The eighth commandment
               <em>presupposes and assumes the right of every man to his powers, and their
                  product.</em> Slavery robs of both. A man's right to himself is the only
               right absolutely original and intrinsic&#8212;his right to whatever else that
               belongs to him is merely <em>relative</em> to his right to himself&#8212;is
               derived from it, and held only by virtue of it. SELF-RIGHT is the
               <i>foundation right</i>&#8212;the <em>post in the
                  middle</em>, to which all other rights are fastened. Slaveholders,
               the world over, when talking about their RIGHT to their slaves,
               always assume <em>their own right to themselves</em>. What slaveholder
               ever undertook to prove his own right to himself? He knows it to be a
               self-evident proposition, that <em>a man belongs to himself</em>&#8212;that
               the right is intrinsic and absolute. The slaveholder, in making out his own
               title to himself, makes out the title of every human being to
               <em>himself</em>. As the fact of being <em>a man</em> is itself the
               title, the whole human family have one common title deed. If <em>one</em>
               man's title is valid, <em>all</em> are valid. If one is worthless, all
               are. To deny the validity of the <em>slave's</em> title is to deny
               the validity of <em>his own</em>; and yet in the act of making him a
               slave, the slaveholder <em>asserts</em> the validity of his
               own title, while he seizes <em>him</em> as his property who has the
               <em>same</em> title. Further, in making him a slave,

               he does not merely unhumanize <em>one</em> individual, but UNIVERSAL MAN.
               He destroys the foundations. He annihilates <em>all rights</em>. He
               attacks not only the human race, but <em>universal being</em>, and
               rushes upon JEHOVAH.&#8212;For rights are <em>rights</em>; God's are no
               more&#8212;man's are no less.

               record of actions is no comment on their moral character. It vouches for
               them as <em>facts</em>, not as <em>virtues</em>. It records without
               rebuke, Noah's drunkenness, Lot's incest, and the lies of Jacob and his
               mother&#8212;not only single acts, but <em>usages</em>, such as polygamy
               and concubinage, are entered on the record without censure. Is that
               <em>silent entry</em> God's <em>endorsement</em>?
               Because the Bible, in its catalogue of human actions, does not stamp on every
               crime its name and number, and write against it, <em>this is a
                  crime</em>&#8212;does that wash out its guilt, and bleach it into a

               The eighth commandment forbids the taking of <em>any</em> part of that
               which belongs to another. Slavery takes the <em>whole</em>. Does the same
               Bible which forbids the taking of <em>any</em> thing belonging to him,
               sanction the taking of <em>every</em> thing? Is it such a medley of
               absurdities as to thunder wrath against him who robs his neighbor of a
               <em>cent</em>, while it bids God speed to him who robs his neighbor of
               <em>himself</em>? Slavery is the highest possible violation of the eighth
               commandment. To take from a man his earnings, is theft. But to take the
               <em>earner</em>, is compound, superlative,
               perpetual theft. It is to be a thief by profession. It is a trade,
               a life of robbery, that vaults through all the gradations of the climax at
               a leap&#8212;the dread, terrific, giant robbery, that towers among other robberies,
               a solitary horror, monarch of the realm. The eighth commandment
               forbids the taking away, and the <em>tenth</em> adds,
               "<em>Thou shalt not COVET any thing that is thy neighbor's</em>;" thus
               guarding every man's right to himself and his property, by making not only
               the actual taking away a sin, but even that state of mind which would
               <em>tempt</em> to it. Who ever made human beings slaves, or held them as
               slaves without <i>coveting</i> them? Why do they take from
               them their time, their labor, their liberty, their right of self-preservation
               and improvement, their right to acquire property, to worship according to
               conscience, to search the Scriptures, to live with their families, and their
               right to their own bodies? Why do they <em>take</em> them, if they do not
               <em>desire</em> them? They COVET them for purposes of gain, convenience,
               lust of dominion, of sensual gratification, of pride and ostentation.
               <em>They break the tenth commandment</em>, and pluck down upon their heads
               the plagues that are written in the book. <em>Ten</em> commandments
               constitute the brief compend of human duty. <em>Two</em>
               of these brand slavery as sin.

               Over the gateway of that system, fearful words were written by the

               the most eminent of the Jewish writers, (if we except perhaps the Egyptian
               Maimonides,) who wrote seven hundred years ago, in his comment on this
               stealing and making merchandize of men, gives the meaning thus:&#8212;"Using a
               man against his will, as a servant lawfully purchased; yea though he should
               use his services ever so little, only to the value of a farthing, or use but
               his arm to lean on to support him, <em>if he be forced so to act as a
                  servant</em>, the person compelling him but once to do so shall die as a
               thief, whether he has sold him or not."
            </p>
            <p>
               The Hebrew word, <i>Gaunab</i>, here
               rendered <i>stealeth</i>, means the taking
               from another what <em>belongs</em> to him, whether it be by violence
               or fraud; the same word is used in the eighth commandment, and prohibits both
               <i>robbery</i> and theft.

            </p>
            <p>
               The crime specified is that of <em>depriving</em> SOMEBODY
               <em>of the ownership of a man</em>. Is this somebody a master? and is the
               crime that of depriving a <em>master</em> of his <em>servant</em>?
               Then it would have been "he that stealeth" a <em>servant, not</em> "he
               that stealeth a <em>man</em>." If the crime had been the taking of an
               individual from <em>another</em>, then the <em>term</em> used would
               have been <em>expressive of that relation</em>, and
               <em>most especially</em> if it was the relation of property and
               <i>proprietor</i>!

            </p>
            <p>
               The crime, as stated in the passage, is three-fold&#8212;man <em>stealing</em>,
               <em>selling</em> and <em>holding</em>. All are put on a level, and
               whelmed under one penalty&#8212;DEATH. This <em>somebody</em> deprived of the
               ownership of man, is the <em>man himself</em>, robbed of personal
               ownership. Joseph said to the servants of Pharoah, "Indeed I was
               <em>stolen</em> away out of the land of the Hebrews." Gen. xl. 15. How
               <em>stolen</em>? His brethren took him and sold him as an <em>article
                  of merchandize</em>. Contrast this penalty for <em>man</em>-stealing
               with that for <em>property</em>-stealing. Exod. xxii. If a man stole an
               <em>ox</em> and killed or sold it, he was to restore five oxen; if he
               had neither sold nor killed it, the penalty was two oxen. The selling or the
               killing being virtually a deliberate repetition of the crime, the penalty was
               more than doubled.

            </p>
            <p>
               But in the case of stealing a <em>man</em>, the first act drew down the
               utmost power of punishment; however often repeated, or however aggravated the
               crime, human penalty could do no more. The fact that the penalty for
               <em>man</em>-stealing was death, and the penalty for
               <em>property</em>-stealing, the mere <em>restoration of double</em>,
               shows that the two cases were adjudicated on totally different principles.
               The man stolen might be past labor, and his support a <em>burden</em>,
               yet death was the penalty, though not a cent's worth of
               <i>property value</i> was taken. The penalty for stealing
               <em>property</em> was a mere <em>property penalty</em>. However
               large the amount stolen, the payment of <em>double</em> wiped out the
               score. It might have a greater <em>money</em> value than a
               <em>thousand</em> men, yet <em>death</em> was never the penalty, nor
               maiming, nor branding, nor even <em>stripes</em>. Whatever the kind, or
               the amount stolen, the unvarying penalty was double of <em>the same
                  kind</em>. Why was not the rule uniform? When a <em>man</em> was stolen
               why not require the thief to restore <em>double of the same kind&#8212;two
                  men</em>, or if he had sold him, <em>five</em> men? Do you say that
               the man-thief might not <em>have</em> them? So the <em>ox</em>-thief
               might not have two <em>oxen</em>, or if he had killed it,
               <em>five</em>. But if God permitted men to hold <em>men</em> as
               property, equally with <em>oxen</em>, the <em>man</em>-thief could
               get <em>men</em> with whom to pay the penalty, as well as
               the <em>ox</em>-thief, <em>oxen</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               Further, when <em>property</em> was stolen, the whole of the legal penalty
               was a compensation to the person injured. But when a <em>man</em> was
               stolen, no property compensation was offered. To tender <em>money</em> as
               an equivalent, would have been to repeat the outrage with the intolerable
               aggravations of supreme insult and impiety. Compute the value of a MAN in
               <em>money!</em> Throw dust into the scale against immortality! The law
               recoiled from such outrage and blasphemy. To have permitted the man-thief to
               expiate his crime by restoring double, would have

               been making the repetition of crime its atonement. But the infliction
               of death for <i>man-stealing</i> exacted from the guilty
               wretch the utmost possibility of reparation. It wrung from him, as he gave up
               the ghost, a testimony in blood, and death groans, to the infinite dignity and
               worth of man,&#8212;a proclamation to the universe, voiced in mortal agony,
               that MAN IS INVIOLABLE,&#8212;a confession shrieked in phrenzy at the
               grave's mouth&#8212;"I die accursed, and God is just."

            </p>
            <p>
               If God permitted man to hold <em>man</em> as property, why did He punish
               for stealing <em>that</em> kind of property infinitely more than for
               stealing any <em>other</em> kind of property? Why did he punish with
               <em>death</em> for stealing a very little, perhaps not a sixpence worth,
               of <em>that</em> sort of property, and make a mere <em>fine</em>, the
               penalty for stealing a thousand times as much, of any other sort of
               property&#8212;especially if God did by his own act annihilate the difference
               between man and <em>property</em>, by putting him <em>on a level with
                  it</em>?

            </p>
            <p>
               The atrociousness of a crime, depends greatly upon the nature, character,
               and condition of the victim. To steal is a crime, whoever the
               thief, or whatever the plunder. To steal bread from a <em>full</em> man,
               is theft; to steal it from a <em>starving</em> man, is both theft and
               murder. If I steal my neighbor's <em>property</em>, the crime consists
               not in the <i>nature</i> of the article, but in
               <em>shifting its external relation</em> from <em>him to me</em>. But
               when I take my neighbor <em>himself</em>, and first make him
               <i>property</i>, and then <em>my</em>
               property, the latter act, which was the sole crime in the former case,
               dwindles to a mere appendage. The sin in stealing a man does not
               consist in transferring, from its owner to another, that which is
               <em>already property</em>, but in turning
               <i>personality</i> into
               <i>property</i>. True, the
               <i>attributes</i> of man still remain, but the rights and
               immunities which grow out of them are <em>annihilated</em>. It is the
               first law of reason and revelation to regard things and beings as they are;
               and the sum of religion, to feel and act toward them according to their
               nature and value. Knowingly to treat them otherwise, is
               <i>sin</i>; and the degree of violence done to their
               nature, relations, and value, measures its guilt. When things are sundered
               which God has indissolubly joined, or confounded in one, which
               he has separated by infinite extremes; when sacred and eternal distinctions,
               which he has garnished with glory, are derided and set at nought,
               then, if ever, <i>sin</i> reddens in its "scarlet dye."
               The sin specified in the passage, is that of doing violence to the
               <i>nature</i> of a <em>man</em>&#8212;his
               <i>intrinsic value</i> and relations as a rational being,
               and blotting out the exalted distinction stamped upon him by his Maker. In the
               verse preceding, and in that which follows, the same principle is laid down.
               Verse 15,

               "<em>He then smiteth his father or his mother shall surely be put to
                  death.</em>" Verse 17, "<em>He that curseth his father or his mother,
                  shall surely be put to death.</em>" If a Jew smote his neighbor, the law
               merely smote him in return. But if that same blow were given to a
               <em>parent</em>, the law struck the smiter <em>dead</em>. Why this
               difference in the punishment of the same act, inflicted on different persons?
               Answer&#8212;God guards the parental relation with peculiar care. It is the
               <em>centre</em> of human relations. To violate that, is to violate
               <em>all</em>. Whoever trampled on <em>that</em>, showed that
               no relation had any sacredness in his eyes&#8212;that he was unfit to move
               among human relations who had violated one so sacred and tender.&#8212;Therefore,
               the Mosaic law uplifted his bleeding corpse, and brandished the ghastly terror
               around the parental relation to guard it from impious inroads.

            </p>
            <p>
               But why the difference in the penalty since the <em>act</em> was the same?
               The sin had divers aggravations.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. The relation violated was obvious&#8212;the distinction between parents and
               others, manifest, dictated by natural affection&#8212;a law of the constitution.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. The act was violence to nature&#8212;a suicide on constitutional
               susceptibilities.

               3. The parental relation then, as now, was the centre of the social
               system, and required powerful safe-guards. "<em>Honor thy father and
                  thy mother</em>," stands at the head of those commands which prescribe the
               duties of man to man; and, throughout the Bible, the parental relation
               is God's favorite illustration, of his own relations to the whole family of
               man. In this case, death is inflicted not at all for the act of
               <em>smiting</em>, nor for smiting a <em>man</em>, but a
               <em>parent</em>&#8212;for violating a vital and sacred relation&#8212;a
               <em>distinction</em> cherished by God, and around which, both in the
               moral and ceremonial law, He threw up a bulwark of defence. In the
               next verse, "He that stealeth a man," &amp;c., the SAME PRINCIPLE is
               wrought out in still stronger relief. The crime here punished with
               death, is not the mere act of taking property from its owner, but the
               disregarding of <i>fundamental relations</i>, doing
               violence to an <i>immortal nature</i>, making war on a
               <i>sacred distinction</i> of priceless worth. That
               distinction which is cast headlong by the principle of American slavery;
               which makes MEN "<i>chattels</i>."

            </p>
            <p>
               The incessant pains-taking throughout the old Testament, in the separation
               of human beings from brutes and things, shows God's regard
               for the sacredness of his own distinction.

            </p>
            <p>
               "In the beginning" the Lord uttered it in heaven, and proclaimed it
               to the universe as it rose into being. He arrayed creation at the instant
               of its birth, to do it reverent homage. It paused in adoration while
               He ushered forth its crowning work. Why that dread pause, and that
               creating arm held back in mid career, and that high conference in the
               godhead? "<em>Let us make man in</em> OUR IMAGE, <em>after</em> OUR
               LIKENESS, AND LET HIM HAVE DOMINION <em>over the fish of the sea, and over
                  the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over
                  every living thing that moveth upon the earth</em>."

            </p>
            <p><em>Then</em> while every living thing, with land, and sea, and
               firmament, and marshalled worlds, waited to catch and swell the shout of
               morning stars&#8212;THEN "GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE. IN THE IMAGE OF GOD
               CREATED HE HIM." This solves the problem, IN THE IMAGE OF
               GOD CREATED HE HIM. Well might the sons of God cry all
               together, "Amen, alleluia"&#8212;"<em>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive
                  blessing and honor"&#8212;"For thou hast made him a little lower than the
                  angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor. Thou madest him
                  to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things
                  under his feet. O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the
                  earth</em>." Psalms viii. 5, 6, 9. The frequent and solemn repetition of
               this distinction by God proclaims his infinite regard. The 26th, 27th, and
               28th verses of the 1st chapter of Genesis are little else than the repetition
               of it in various forms. In the 5th chapter, 1st verse, we find
               it again&#8212;"In the day that God created man, IN THE LIKENESS of GOD
               MADE HE MAN." In the 9th chapter, 6th verse, we find it again. After
               giving license to shed the blood of "every moving thing that liveth," it
               is added, "<em>Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed,
                  for</em> IN THE IMAGE OF GOD MADE HE MAN." As though he had said, "All
               these other creatures are your property, designed for your use&#8212;they
               have the likeness of earth, they perish with the using, and their spirits
               go downward; but this other being, MAN, has my own <em>likeness</em>; IN
               THE IMAGE OF GOD made I man; an intelligent, moral, immortal agent, invited
               to all that I can give and he can be." So in Levit. xxiv. 17, 18,
               "<em>He that killeth any</em> MAN <em>shall surely be put to death; and
                  he, that killeth a beast shall make it good, beast for beast; and he that
                  killeth a</em> MAN <em>shall be put to death</em>." So in the passage
               quoted above, Ps. viii. 5, 6. What an enumeration of particulars, each
               separating infinitely, MEN from brutes and things!

            </p>
            <p>
               1. "<em>Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels</em>." Slavery
               drags him down among <em>brutes</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. "<em>And hast crowned him with glory and honor</em>." Slavery tears
               off his crown, and puts on a <em>yoke</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               3. "<em>Thou madest him to have dominion</em> OVER <em>the works of thy
                  hands</em>." Slavery breaks his sceptre, and casts him down
               <em>among</em> those works&#8212;yea, <em>beneath them</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               4. "<em>Thou hast put all things under his feet</em>." Slavery puts HIM
               <em>under the feet of an owner</em>, with beasts and creeping things. Who,
               but an impious scorner, dare thus strive with his Maker, and mutilate HIS
               IMAGE, and blaspheme the Holy One, who saith to those that grind his
               poor, "<em>Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these, ye did
                  it unto me</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               But time would fail us to detail the instances in which this distinction
               is most impressively marked in the Bible.

            </p>
            <p>
               In further prosecuting this inquiry, the Patriarchal and Mosaic systems
               will be considered together, as each reflects light upon the other,
               and as many regulations of the latter are mere
               <i>legal</i> forms of Divine institutions previously
               existing. As a <i>system</i>, however, the latter alone
               is of Divine authority. Whatever were the usages of the
               <i>patriarchs</i>, God has not made them our
               examplars<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN4"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN4"></a>.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN4"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN4">A</a>: Those who insist that the patriarchs
               held slaves, and sit with such delight under their shadow, hymning the
               praises of "those good old patriarchs and slaveholders," might at small
               cost greatly augment their numbers. A single stanza celebrating patriarchal
               <i>concubinage</i>, winding off with a chorus in honor
               of patriarchal <em>drunkenness</em>, would be a trumpet call, summoning
               from bush and brake, highway and hedge, and sheltering fence, a brotherhood
               of kindred affinities, each claiming Abraham or Noah as his patron saint, and
               shouting, "My name is legion." What a myriad choir, and thunderous
               song!

               Before entering upon an analysis of the condition of servants under
               these two states of society, let us settle the import of certain terms
               which describe the mode of procuring them.

            <h3><a name="E4_buy"></a>IMPORT OF THE WORD "BUY," AND THE PHRASE "BOUGHT WITH MONEY."
            </h3>
            <p>
               From the direction to the Israelites to "buy" their servants,
               and from the phrase "bought with money," applied to Abraham's servants,
               it is argued that they were articles of <i>property</i>.
               The sole ground for this belief is the <i>terms</i> "buy"
               and "bought with money," and such an import to these terms when applied to
               servants is assumed, not only in the absence of all proof, but in the face of
               evidence to the contrary. How much might be saved, if in discussion, the thing
               to be proved was always <em>assumed</em>. To <em>beg</em> the question
               in debate, what economy of midnight

               oil! what a forestaller of premature wrinkles, and grey hairs! Instead
               of protracted investigation into Scripture usage, and painful collating
               of passages, and cautiously tracing minute relations, to find the
               meaning of Scripture terms, let every man boldly resolve to interpret
               the language of the oldest book in the world, by the usages of his own
               time and place, and the work is done. And then what a march of
               mind! Instead of <em>one</em> revelation, they might be multiplied as
               the drops of the morning! Every man might take orders as an inspired
               interpreter, with an infallible clue to the mind of the Spirit, if he only
               understood the dialect of his own neighborhood! We repeat it, the only
               ground of proof that these terms are to be interpreted to mean, when
               applied to servants in the Bible, the same that they mean when applied
               to our <em>slaves, is the terms themselves.</em></p>
            <p>
               What a Babel-jargon it would make of the Bible to take it for granted
               that the sense in which words are <em>now</em> used is the
               <em>inspired</em> sense.

            </p>
            <p>
               David says, "I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried."
               What a miracle-worker, to stop the earth in its revolution! Rather too
               fast. Two hundred years ago, <i>prevent</i> was used in
               the strict Latin sense to <em>come before</em>, or
               <i>anticipate</i>. It is always used in this sense in the
               Old and New Testaments. David's expression, in the English of the nineteenth
               century, is, "Before the dawning of the morning I cried," or, I
               began to cry before day-break. "So my prayer shall
               <i>prevent</i> thee."
               "Let us <i>prevent</i> his face with thanksgiving." "Mine
               eyes <i>prevent</i> the night watches." "We shall not
               <i>prevent</i> them that are asleep," &amp;c.
               In almost every chapter of the Bible, words are used in a sense now
               nearly or quite obsolete, and sometimes in a sense totally
               <em>opposite</em> to their present meaning. A few examples follow:
               "Oftentimes I purposed to come to you, but was <i>let</i>
               (hindered) hitherto." "And the four <i>beasts</i> (living
               ones) fell down and worshipped God,"&#8212;Whosoever shall
               <i>offend</i> (cause to sin) one of these little
               ones,"&#8212;Go out into the high ways and <i>compel</i>
               (urge) them to come in,"&#8212;Only let your
               <i>conversation</i> (habitual conduct or course of life)
               be as becometh the Gospel,"&#8212;They that seek me
               <i>early</i> (earnestly) shall find me,&#8212;Give me
               <i>by and by</i> (now) in a charger, the head of John the
               Baptist,"&#8212;So when tribulation or persecution ariseth
               <i>by-and-by</i> (immediately) they are offended. Nothing
               is more mutable than language. Words, like bodies, are continually throwing
               off particles and absorbing others. So long as they are mere
               <i>representatives,</i> elected by the whims of universal
               suffrage, their meaning will be a perfect volatile, and to cork it up for
               the next century is an employment sufficiently silly, (to speak within

               bounds,) for a modern Bible dictionary maker. There never was a
               shallower conceit than that of establishing the sense attached to a word
               centuries ago, by showing what it means <em>now</em>. Pity that
               hyper-fashionable mantuamakers and milliners were not a little quicker at
               taking hints from some of our Doctors of Divinity. How easily they could
               save their pious customers all qualms of conscience about the weekly
               shiftings of fashion, by demonstrating that the last importation of Parisian
               indecency, just now flaunting here on promenade, was the identical
               style of dress in which the pious Sarah kneaded cakes for the angels,
               the modest Rebecca drew water for the camels of Abraham's servants.
               Since such fashions are rife in Chestnut-street and Broadway <em>now</em>,
               they <em>must</em> have been in Canaan and Pandanaram four thousand years
               ago!

               II. 1. The inference that the word buy, used to describe the procuring
               of servants, means procuring them as <i>chattels</i>,
               seems based upon the fallacy&#8212;that whatever <em>costs</em> money
               <em>is</em> money; that whatever or whoever you pay money
               <em>for</em>, is an article of property, and the fact of your paying for
               it <em>proves</em> that it is property. The children of Israel were
               required to <em>purchase</em> their first-born out from under the
               obligations of the priesthood, Numb. xviii. 15, 16; Exod. xxxiv. 20. This
               custom is kept up to this day among the Jews, and the word <em>buy</em>
               is still used to describe the transaction. Does this prove that their
               first-born were, or are, held as property? They were <em>bought</em> as
               really as were <em>servants</em>. So the Israelites were required to
               <em>pay money</em> for their own souls. This is called sometimes a ransom,
               sometimes an atonement. Were their <em>souls</em> therefore marketable
               commodities?

            </p>
            <p>
               2. Bible saints <em>bought</em> their wives. Boaz <em>bought</em>
               Ruth. "So Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I
               <em>purchased</em> to be my wife." Ruth iv. 10. Hosea bought his wife.
               "So I <em>bought</em> her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an
               homer of barley, and an half homer of barley." Hosea iii. 2. Jacob
               <em>bought</em> his wives Rachel and Leah, and
               not having money, paid for them in labor&#8212;seven years a piece. Gen.
               xxix. 15-29. Moses probably bought his wife in the same way, and
               paid for her by his labor, as the servant of her father. Exod. ii. 21.
               Shechem, when negotiating with Jacob and his sons for Dinah, says,
               "What ye shall say unto me, I will <em>give</em>. Ask me never so much
               dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me."
               Gen. xxxiv. 11, 12. David purchased Michal, Saul's daughter, and
               Othniel, Achsab, the daughter of Caleb, by performing perilous services
               for the benefit of their fathers-in-law. 1 Sam. xviii. 25-27; Judges i.
               12, 13. That the purchase of wives, either with money or by service

               was the general practice, is plain from such passages as Exod. xxii. 17,
               and 1 Sam. xviii. 25. Among the Jews of the present day this usage
               exists, though it is now a mere form, there being no <em>real</em>
               purchase. Yet among their marriage ceremonies, is one called "marrying by the
               penny." The coincidences, not only in the methods of procuring wives
               and servants, and in the terms employed in describing the transactions,
               but in the prices paid for each, are worthy of notice. The highest price
               of wives (virgins) and servants was the same. Compare Deut. xxii.
               28, 29, and Exod. xxii. 17, with Lev. xxvii. 2-8. The <em>medium</em>
               price of wives and servants was the same. Compare Hosea iii. 2, with Exod.
               xxi. 2. Hosea appears to have paid one half in money and the other
               in grain. Further, the Israelitish female bought-servants were
               <em>wives</em>, their husbands and their masters being the same persons.
               Exod. xxi. 8, and Judges xix. 3, 27. If <em>buying</em> servants among
               the Jews shows that they were property, then buying <em>wives</em> shows
               that <em>they</em> were property. The words in the original used to
               describe the one, describe the other. Why not contend that the wives of the
               ancient fathers of the faithful were their chattels, and used as ready change
               at a pinch? And thence deduce the rights of modern husbands. How far gone is
               the Church from primitive purity! How slow to emulate illustrious examples!
               Alas! Patriarchs and prophets are followed afar off! When will pious
               husbands live up to their Bible privileges, and become partakers with
               Old Testament worthies in the blessedness of a husband's rightful immunities!
               Surely professors of religion now, are <em>bound</em> to buy and hold
               their wives as property! Refusing so to do, is to question the morality
               of those "good old" wife-trading "patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and
               Jacob," with the prophets, and a host of whom the world was not
               worthy.

            </p>
            <p>
               The use of the word buy, to describe the procuring of wives, is not
               peculiar to the Hebrew. In the Syriac language, the common expression
               for "the married," or "the espoused," is "the bought." Even
               so late as the 16th century, the common record of <em>marriages</em> in
               the old German Chronicles was "A. BOUGHT B."

               The Hebrew word translated <em>buy</em>, is, like other words, modified by
               the nature of the subject to which it is applied. Eve says, "I have
               <i>gotten</i> (bought) a man of the Lord." She named him
               Cain, that is, <em>bought</em>. "He that heareth reproof, getteth
               (buyeth) understanding", Prov. xv. 32. So in Isa. xi. 11. "The Lord shall set
               his hand again to recover (to <em>buy</em>) the remnant of his people."
               So Ps. lxxviii. 54.
               He brought them to this mountain which his right hand had
               <em>purchased</em>,
               i.e. gotten. Jer. xiii. 4. "Take the girdle that thou hast got"
               (bought.) Neh. v. 8. "We of our ability have
               <i>redeemed</i> (bought) our brethren that were sold to
               the heathen." Here "<em>bought</em>" is not applied to persons
               who were made slaves, but to those taken <em>out</em> of slavery. Prov.
               8. 22. "The Lord possessed (bought) me in the beginning of his way before his
               works of old." Prov. xix. 8. "He that <em>getteth</em>
               (buyeth) wisdom loveth his own soul." Prov. xvi. 16. "How much
               better is it to <em>get</em> (buy) wisdom than gold?" Finally, to
               <em>buy</em> is a <em>secondary</em> meaning of the Hebrew word
               <i>Kana</i>.

            </p>
            <p>
               4. Even at this day the word <em>buy</em> is used to describe the
               procuring of servants, where slavery is abolished. In the British West
               Indies, where slaves became apprentices in 1834, they are still "bought."
               This is now the current word in West India newspapers. So a few years since
               in New-York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and even now in New-Jersey
               servants are "<em>bought</em>" as really as in Virginia. And the different
               senses in which the same word is used in the two states, puts no man
               in a quandary, whose common sense amounts to a modicum.

               So under the system of legal <i>indenture</i> in Illinois,
               servants now are "<em>bought</em>."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN5"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN5"></a> A short time since,
               hundreds of foreigners who came to this country were "bought" annually. By
               voluntary contract they engaged to work for their purchasers a given time to
               pay for their passage. This class of persons called "redemptioners," consisted
               at one time of thousands. Multitudes are <em>bought out</em> of slavery by
               themselves or others, and remove into free states. Under the same roof with
               the writer is a "servant bought with money." A few weeks since, she was a
               slave. As soon as "bought," she was a slave no longer. Alas! for
               our leading politicians if "buying" men makes them "chattels." The
               Whigs say that Benton and Rives were "bought" by the administration
               with the surplus revenue; and the other party, that Clay and Webster
               were "bought" by the Bank. The histories of the revolution tell us
               that Benedict Arnold was "bought" by British gold. Did that make
               him an article of property? When a northern clergyman marries a
               rich southern widow, country gossip hits off the indecency with this
               current phrase, "The cotton bags <em>bought</em> him." When Robert
               Walpole said, "Every man has his price, and whoever will pay it can
               <em>buy</em> him," and when John Randolph said, while the Missouri
               question was pending,

               "The northern delegation is in the market; give me money enough,
               and I can <em>buy</em> them," they both meant <em>just what they
                  said</em>. When the temperance publications tell us that candidates for
               office <em>buy</em> men with whiskey; and the oracles of street tattle,
               that the court, district attorney, and jury, in the late trial of Robinson
               were <em>bought</em>, we have no floating visions of "chattels personal,"
               man auctions, or coffles.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN5"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN5">A</a>: The following
               statute is now in force in the state of Illinois&#8212;"No negro, mulatto, or
               Indian, shall at any time <em>purchase</em> any servant other than of
               their own complexion: and if any of the persons aforesaid shall presume to
               <em>purchase</em> a white servant, such servant shall immediately become

            <p>
               The transaction between Joseph and the Egyptians gives a clue to
               the meaning attached to "buy" and "bought with money." See Gen.
               xlvii. 18-26. The Egyptians proposed to Joseph to become servants,
               and that he should <em>buy</em> them. When the bargain was closed, Joseph
               said, "Behold I have <em>bought you</em> this day," and yet it is plain
               that neither of the parties dreamed that the persons <em>bought</em> were
               in any sense articles of property, but merely that they became thereby
               obligated to labor for the government on certain conditions, as a
               <em>compensation</em> for the entire support of themselves and families
               during the famine. And that the idea attached to "buy us," and "behold I have
               bought you," was merely the procuring of services voluntarily offered, and
               secured by contract, as a return for <em>value received</em>, and not at
               all that the Egyptians were bereft of their personal ownership, and made
               articles of property. And this buying of <em>services</em> (they were to
               give one-fifth part of their crops to Pharaoh) is called in Scripture usage,
               <i>buying the persons</i>. This case deserves special
               notice, as it is the only one where the whole transaction of buying servants
               is detailed&#8212;the preliminaries, the process, the mutual acquiescence, and the
               permanent relation resulting therefrom. In all other instances, the
               <em>mere fact</em> is stated without entering
               into particulars. In this case, the whole process is laid open.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. The persons "bought," <em>sold themselves</em>, and of their own
               accord.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. Obtaining permanently the <em>services</em> of persons, or even a
               portion of them, is called "buying" those persons. The objector, at the
               outset, assumes that servants were bought of <em>third</em> persons; and
               thence infers that they were articles of property. This is sheer
               <em>assumption</em>. Not a single instance is recorded, of a servant being
               sold by any one but himself; not a case, either under the patriarchal, or the
               Mosaic systems, in which a <em>master sold his servant</em>. That the
               servants who were "bought" <em>sold themselves</em>, is a fair inference
               from various passages of Scripture.

            </p>
            <p>
               In Leviticus xxv. 47, the case of the Israelite, who became the servant
               of the stranger, the words are, "If he SELL HIMSELF unto the
               stranger." The <em>same word</em>, and the same <em>form</em> of the
               word, which, in the 47th verse, is rendered <em>sell himself</em>, is in
               the 39th verse of the same

               chapter, rendered <em>be sold</em>; in Deut. xxviii. 68, the same word is
               rendered "<em>be sold</em>." Here it is the Hithpael conjugation, which is
               reflexive in its force, and, like the middle voice in Greek, represents what
               an individual does for himself; or in his own concerns; and should manifestly
               have been rendered, ye shall <em>offer yourselves</em> for sale. For a
               clue to Scripture usage on this point, see 1 Kings xxi. 20, 25&#8212;"Thou hast
               <em>sold thyself</em> to work evil." "There was none like to Ahab that
               <em>sold himself</em> to work wickedness."&#8212;2 Kings xvii. 17. "They used
               divination and enchantments, and <em>sold themselves</em> to do
               evil."&#8212;Isa. l. 1. "For your iniquities have ye <em>sold yourselves</em>."
               Isa. lii. 3, "Ye have <em>sold yourselves</em> FOR NOUGHT, and ye shall
               be redeemed without money." See also, Jeremiah xxxiv. 14&#8212;Romans vii. 14, and
               vi. 16&#8212;John viii. 34, and the case of Joseph and the Egyptians, already
               quoted.

            </p>
            <p>
               Again, if servants were <em>bought of third persons</em>, where are the
               instances? In the purchase of wives, though spoken of rarely, it is generally
               stated that they were bought of <em>third</em> persons. Is it not a fair
               inference, if servants were bought of third persons, that there would
               <em>sometimes</em> have been such an intimation?

               II.-THE LEADING DESIGN OF THE MOSAIC LAWS RELATING TO MASTERS
               AND SERVANTS, WITH AN ENUMERATION OF THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES SECURED TO SERVANTS.

            </h3>
            <p>
               The general object of those statutes, which prescribed the relations of
               master and servant, was the good of both parties&#8212;but more especially
               the good of the <em>servants</em>. While the interests of the master were
               specially guarded from injury, those of the servants were
               <em>promoted</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               These laws were a merciful provision for the poorer classes, both of
               the Israelites and Strangers. Not laying on burdens, but lightening
               them&#8212;they were a grant of <em>privileges</em>&#8212;a bestowment of
               <em>favors</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. <em>No servant from the Strangers, could remain a servant in the family
                  of an Israelite, without becoming a proselyte</em>. Compliance with
               this condition was the <em>price of the privilege</em>.&#8212;Genesis xvii.
               9-14, 23, 27.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. <em>Excommunication from the family was a</em> PUNISHMENT.&#8212;Genesis
               xxi. 14-Luke xvi. 2-4.

            </p>
            <p>
               3. <em>The fact that every Hebrew servant could</em> COMPEL <em>his
                  master to keep him after the six years contract had, expired</em>, shows
               that the system was framed to advance the interests and gratify the wishes of
               the servant <em>quite as much</em> as those of the master. If the servant
               <em>demanded</em> it, the

               law <em>obliged</em> the master to retain him in his household, however
               little he might need his services, or great his dislike to the individual.
               Deut. xv. 12-17, and Exodus xxi. 2-6.

            </p>
            <p>
               4. <em>The rights and privileges guaranteed by law to all servants.</em>
               (1.) <em>They were admitted into covenant with God.</em> Deut. xxix.
               10-13.

            </p>
            <p>
               (2.) <em>They were invited guests at all the national and family festivals
                  of the household in which they resided.</em> Exodus xii. 43-44; Deut. xii.
               12, 18, and xvi. 10-16.

            </p>
            <p>
               (3.) <em>They were statedly instructed in morality and religion.</em>
               Deut. xxxi. 10-13; Joshua viii. 33-35; 2 Chronicles xvii. 8-9.

            </p>
            <p>
               (4.) <em>They were released from their regular labor nearly</em> ONE HALF
               OF THE WHOLE TIME. During which, the law secured to them their entire
               support; and the same public and family instruction that was provided
               for the other members of the Hebrew community.

            </p>
            <p>
               (a.) The Law secured to them the <em>whole of every seventh year</em>;
               Lev. xxv. 3-6; thus giving to those servants that remained such during the
               entire period between the jubilees, <em>eight whole years</em> (including
               the Jubilee year) of unbroken rest.

            </p>
            <p>
               (b.) <em>Every seventh day</em>. This in forty-two years, (the eight
               being subtracted from the fifty) would amount to just <em>six years</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               (c.) <em>The three great annual festivals</em>. The <em>Passover</em>,
               which commenced on the 15th of the 1st month, and lasted seven days,
               Deut. xvi. 3, 8. The Pentecost, or Feast of Weeks, which began on the sixth
               day of the third month, and lasted seven days. Lev. xxiii. 15-21. And
               the Feast of Tabernacles, which commenced on the 15th of the seventh
               month, and lasted eight days. Deut. xvi. 13, 15; Lev. xxiii. 34-39.
               As all met in one place, much time would be spent on the journey.
               Their cumbered caravans moved slowly. After their arrival at the
               place of sacrifice, a day or two at least, would be requisite for divers
               preparations, before entering upon the celebration of the festival, besides
               some time at the close of it, in preparations for their return. If we
               assign three weeks to each festival&#8212;including the time spent on the
               journey going and returning, and the delays before and after the celebration,
               together with the <em>festival week</em>; it will be a small allowance for
               the cessation of their regular labor. As there were three festivals
               in the year, the main body of the servants would be absent from their
               stated employments at least <em>nine weeks annually</em>, which would
               amount in forty-two years, subtracting the sabbaths, to six years and
               eighty-four days.

            </p>
            <p>
               (e.) <em>The new moons</em>. The Jewish year had twelve; Josephus tells
               us that the Jews always kept <em>two</em> days for the new moon. See
               Calmet on the Jewish Calender, and Horne's Introduction; also 1 Sam. xx,
               18, 19, 27. This would amount in forty-two years, to two years, two
               hundred and eighty days, after the necessary subtractions.

            </p>
            <p>
               (f.) <em>The feast of trumpets</em>. On the first day of the seventh
               month, and of the civil year. Lev. xxiii. 24, 25.

            </p>
            <p>
               (g.) <em>The day of atonement</em>. On the tenth of the seventh month.
               Lev. xxiii. 27-32.

            </p>
            <p>
               These two last feasts would consume not less than sixty-five days of
               time not otherwise reckoned.

            </p>
            <p>
               Thus it appears that those persons who continued servants during the
               whole period between the jubilees, were by law released from their
               labor,
               TWENTY-THREE YEARS AND SIXTY-FOUR DAYS, OUT OF FIFTY YEARS,
               and those who remained a less time, in nearly the same proportion. In
               the foregoing calculation, besides making a generous donation of all the
               <em>fractions</em> to the objector, we have left out of the account,
               those numerous <em>local</em> festivals to which frequent allusion is
               made, as in Judges xxi. 19; 1 Sam. 9th chapter. And the various
               <em>family</em> festivals, such as at the weaning of children; at
               marriages; at sheep shearings; at the making of covenants, &amp;c., to which
               reference is often made, as in 1st Sam. xx. 28, 29. Neither have we included
               those memorable festivals instituted at a later period of the Jewish history.
               The feast of Purim, Esther, ix. 28, 29; and the feast of the Dedication, which
               lasted eight days. John x. 22; 1 Mac. iv. 59.

            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, the Mosaic system secured to servants, an amount of time,
               which, if distributed, would on an average be almost ONE HALF OF THE
               DAYS IN EACH YEAR. Meanwhile, they and their families were supported,
               and furnished with opportunities of instruction. If this amount
               of time were distributed over <em>every day</em>, the servants would have
               <em>to themselves</em>, all but a <em>fraction of</em> ONE HALF OF
               EACH DAY, and would labor for their masters the remaining fraction and the
               other half of the day.

            </p>
            <p>
               THIS REGULATION IS A PART OF THAT MOSAIC SYSTEM WHICH IS
               CLAIMED BY SLAVEHOLDERS AS THE GREAT PROTOTYPE OF AMERICAN
               SLAVERY.

            </p>
            <p>
               5. <em>The servant was protected by law equally with the other members

            </p>
            <p>
               1. Because to become a servant in the family of an Israelite, was to
               abjure idolatry, to enter into covenant with
               God<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN6"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN6"></a>, to be circumcised in

               token of it, to be bound to the observance of the Sabbath, of the Passover,
               the Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles, and to receive instruction
               in all the particulars of the moral and ceremonial law.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN6"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN6">A</a>: Maimonides, who wrote in Egypt about seven
               hundred years ago, a contemporary with Jarchi, and who stands with him at the
               head of Jewish writers, gives the following testimony
               on this point:
               "Whether a servant be born in the power of an Israelite, or whether he be
               purchased from
               the heathen, the master is to bring them both into the covenant."

            </p>
            <p>
               "But he that is in the <em>house</em> is entered on the eighth day, and
               he that is bought with money, on the day on which the master receives him,
               unless the slave be <em>unwilling</em>. For if the master
               receive a grown slave, and he be <em>unwilling</em>, his master is to
               bear with him, to seek to win him over by instruction, and by love and
               kindness, for one year. After which, should he <em>refuse</em> so
               long, it is forbidden to keep him, longer than a year. And the master must
               send him back to the strangers from whence he came. For the God of Jacob
               will not accept any other than the worship of a <em>willing</em>
               heart."&#8212;Maimon, Hilcoth, Miloth, Chap. 1st, Sec. 8th.

            </p>
            <p>
               The ancient Jewish Doctors agree in the testimony, that the servant from the
               strangers who at the close of his probationary year still refused to adopt
               the religion of the Mosaic system, and was on that account cut off from the
               family, and sent back to his own people, received a <em>full
                  compensation</em> for his services, besides the payment of his expenses.
               But that <em>postponement</em> of the circumcision of the foreign servant
               for a year (<em>or even at all</em> after he had entered the family of
               an Israelite) of which the Mishnic doctors speak, seems to have been
               <i>a mere usage</i>. We find nothing of it in the
               regulations of the Mosaic system. Circumcision was manifestly a rite
               strictly <em>initiatory</em>. Whether it was a rite merely
               <em>national</em> or <em>spiritual</em>, or <em>both</em>,
               comes not within the scope of this inquiry. Nor does it at all affect the
               argument.
            </p>
            <p>
               Were the servants <em>forced</em> through all these processes? Was the
               renunciation of idolatry <em>compulsory</em>? Were they
               <em>dragged</em> into covenant with God? Were they seized and circumcised
               by <em>main strength</em>? Were they <em>compelled</em> mechanically
               to chew, and swallow, the flesh of the Paschal lamb, while they abhorred the
               institution, despised its ceremonies, spurned the law which enjoined it,
               detested its author and executors, and instead of rejoicing in the
               deliverance which it commemmorated, bewailed it as a calamity, and cursed the
               day of its consummation?
               Were they <em>driven</em> from all parts of the land three times in the
               year up to the annual festivals? Were they drugged with instruction
               which they nauseated? Were they goaded through a round of ceremonies,
               to them senseless and disgusting mummeries; and drilled into
               the tactics of a creed rank with loathed abominations?

            </p>
            <p>
               We repeat it, to become a <i>servant</i>, was to become
               a <i>proselyte</i>. And
               how did God authorize his people to make proselytes? At the point of
               the sword? By the terror of pains and penalties? By converting men
               into <em>merchandise</em>? Were <i>proselyte</i> and
               <i>chattel</i> synonymes, in the Divine
               vocabulary? Must a man be sunk to a <em>thing</em> before taken into
               covenant with God? Was this the stipulated condition of adoption, and
               the sole passport to the communion of the saints?

            </p>
            <p>
               2. We argue the voluntariness of servants from Deut. xxiii. 15, 16,
               "<em>Thou shall not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped
                  from his master unto thee. He shall dwell with thee, even among
                  you, in that place which he shall choose, in one of thy gates where it
                  liketh him best; thou shalt not oppress him</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               As though God had said, "To deliver him up would be to recognize the
               <em>right</em> of the master to hold him. His <em>fleeing</em> "shows
               his <em>choice</em>&#8212;proclaims his wrongs, his master's oppressive acts,
               and his own claim to legal protection." You shall not force him back, and
               thus recognize the <em>right</em> of the master to hold him in such a
               condition as induces him to flee to others for protection." It may be
               objected, that this command had no reference to servants among the
               <em>Israelites</em>, but only to those of <em>heathen</em> masters
               in the surrounding nations. We answer, The regulation has no restriction.
               Its terms are unlimited. But the objection, even if valid, merely shifts
               the pressure of the difficulty to another point. Does God array his infinite
               authority to protect the <em>free choice</em> of a <em>single</em>
               servant from the heathen, and yet <em>authorize</em> the same persons,
               to crush the free choice of <em>thousands</em> of servants from the
               heathen! Suppose a case. A <em>foreign</em> servant flees from his master
               to the Israelites; God speaks, "He shall dwell with thee, in that place which
               <em>he shall choose</em>, in one of thy gates where it <em>liketh</em>
               him best." They were strictly charged not to put him in a condition which he
               did not <em>choose</em>. Now, suppose this same servant, instead of coming
               into Israel of his own accord, had been <em>dragged</em> in by some
               kidnapper who <em>bought</em> him of his master, and <em>forced</em>
               him into a condition against his will. Would He who forbade such treatment of
               the stranger, who <em>voluntarily</em> came into the land, sanction the
               <em>same</em> treatment of the <em>same person</em>, provided in
               <em>addition</em> to this last outrage, the <em>previous</em> one
               had been committed of <em>forcing him into the nation against his
                  will</em>?

            </p>
            <p>
               To commit violence on the free choice of a <em>foreign</em> servant is
               a horrible enormity, forsooth, PROVIDED you <em>begin</em> the violence
               <em>after</em> he has come among you. But if you commit the <em>first
                  act</em>, on the <em>other side of the line</em>; if you
               <em>begin</em> the outrage by buying him from a third person
               <em>against his will</em>, and then tear him from home, and drag him
               across the line into the land of Israel, and hold him as a slave&#8212;ah!
               that alters the case, and you may perpetrate the violence now with impunity!
               Would <em>greater</em> favor have been shown to this new comer from the
               heathen than to the old residents&#8212;those who had been servants in Jewish
               families perhaps for a generation? Were the Israelites commanded to exercise
               toward <em>him</em>, uncircumcised and <em>out</em> of the covenant,
               a justice and kindness denied to the multitude, who <em>were</em>
               circumcised, and <em>within</em> the covenant?

            </p>
            <p>
               Again: the objector finds small gain to his argument on the supposition
               that the covenant respected merely the fugitives from the surrounding
               nations, while it left the servants of the Israelites in a condition

               against their wills&#8212;the objector finds small gain to his argument. In
               that case, the surrounding nations would of course adopt retaliatory
               measures, and resolve themselves into so many asylums for fugitive
               Israelitish servants. As these nations were on every side of them
               such a proclamation would have been an effectual lure to men held in a
               condition which was a constant <i>counteraction of
                  will</i>. Further, the objector's assumption destroys itself; for the same
               command which protected the foreign servant from the power of his
               <i>master</i>, protected him equally from the power of
               an <i>Israelite</i>. It was not merely, "Thou shalt not
               deliver him to his <i>master</i>," but "he (the servant)
               shall dwell with thee, in that place which <em>he shall choose</em>, in
               one of thy gates where it liketh him best." Every Israelite was commanded to
               respect his free choice, and to put him in no condition <em>against his
                  will</em>. What was this but a proclamation, that all who <em>chose</em>
               to live in the land and obey the laws, were left to their own free will, to
               dispose of their services at such a rate, to such persons, and in such places
               as they pleased?

            </p>
            <p>
               Besides, grant that this command prohibited the sending back of
               <em>foreign</em> servants merely, was the any law requiring the return
               of servants who had escaped from the <em>Israelites</em>? There was a
               statute requiring the return of <em>property</em> lost, and
               <em>cattle</em> escaped, but none requiring the return of escaped
               <em>servants</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, these verses contain, <em>first</em>, a command, "Thou shalt not
               deliver," &amp;c. <em>Secondly</em>, a declaration of the fugitive's right
               of <em>free choice</em>, and of God's will that he should exercise it at
               his own discretion; and <em>thirdly</em>, a command guarding this right,
               namely, "Thou shalt not oppress him," as though God had said, If you forbid
               him to exercise his <em>own choice</em>, as to the place and condition of
               his residence, it is <em>oppression</em>, and I will not tolerate it.

            </p>
            <p>
               3. <em>We argue the voluntariness of servants from their peculiar
                  opportunities and facilities for escape</em>. Three times every year, all
               the males over twelve years of age, were required to attend the public
               festivals. The main body were thus absent from their homes not less than three
               weeks each time, making nine weeks annually. As these caravans
               moved over the country, were there military scouts lining the way, to
               intercept deserters?&#8212;a corporal's guard stationed at each pass of the
               mountains, sentinels pacing the hill-tops, and light horse scouring the
               defiles? What safe contrivance had the Israelites for taking their
               <em>"slaves"</em> three times in a year to Jerusalem and back? When a body
               of slaves is moved any distance in our free and equal
               <i>republic</i>, they are handcuffed to keep them from
               running away, or beating their drivers' brains

               out. Was this the <em>Mosaic</em> plan, or an improvement left for the
               wisdom of Solomon? The usage, doubtless, claims a paternity not less venerable
               and biblical! Perhaps they were lashed upon camels, and transported
               in bundles, or caged up, and trundled on wheels to and fro, and
               while at the Holy City, "lodged in jail for safe keeping," religions services
               <em>extra</em> being appointed, and special "ORAL instruction" for their
               benefit. But meanwhile, what became of the sturdy <em>handmaids</em> left
               at home? What hindered them from marching off in a body? Perhaps
               the Israelitish matrons stood sentry in rotation round the kitchens, while
               the young ladies scoured the country, as mounted rangers, to pick up
               stragglers by day, and patrolled the streets as city guards, keeping a
               sharp look-out at night.

                  of various rites and ceremonies necessarily</em> VOLUNTARY.

            </p>
            <p>
               Suppose a servant from the heathen should, upon entering a Jewish
               family, refuse circumcision; the question whether he shall remain a servant,
               is in his own hands. If a <em>slave</em>, how simple the process of
               emancipation! His <em>refusal</em> did the job. Or, suppose that, at any
               time, he should refuse to attend the tri-yearly feasts, or should eat leavened
               bread during the Passover, or compound the ingredients of the anointing
               oil, he is "cut off from the people;"
               <i>excommunicated</i>.

            </p>
            <p>
               5. <em>We infer the voluntariness of the servants of the Patriarchs from
                  the impossibility of their being held against their wills.</em> The servants
               of Abraham are an illustration. At one time he had three hundred and
               eighteen <i>young men</i> "born in his house," and
               probably many more <em>not</em> born in his house. The whole number of
               his servants of all ages, was probably MANY THOUSANDS. Doubtless, Abraham
               was a man of a million, and Sarah too, a right notable housekeeper; still, it
               is not easy to conceive how they contrived to hold so many thousand servants
               against their wills, unless the patriarch and his wife <em>took turns</em>
               in performing the Hibernian exploit of surrounding them! The neighboring
               tribes, instead of constituting a picket guard to hem in his servants,
               would have been far more likely to sweep them and him into captivity,
               as they did Lot and his household. Besides, Abraham had neither
               "Constitution," nor "compact," nor statutes, nor judicial officers to send
               back his fugitives, nor a truckling police to pounce upon panic-stricken
               women, nor gentleman-kidnappers, suing for patronage, volunteering to
               howl on the track, boasting their blood-hound scent, and pledging their
               "honor" to hunt down and "deliver up," <em>provided</em> they had a
               description of the "flesh marks," and were stimulated in their chivalry by
               <em>pieces of silver</em>. Abraham seems also to have been sadly deficient
               in all the auxiliaries of family government, such as stocks, hand cuffs,
               foot-chains, yokes, gags, and thumb-screws. His destitution of these
               patriarchal indispensables is the more afflicting, when we consider his
               faithful discharge of responsibilities to his household, though so deplorably
               destitute of the needful aids.

               6. <em>We infer that servants were voluntary, from the fact that there is
                  no instance of an Israelitish master ever</em> SELLING
               <i>a servant</i>. Abraham had thousands of servants, but
               appears never to have sold one. Isaac "grew until he became very great," and
               had "great store of servants." Jacob's youth was spent in the family of Laban,
               where he lived a servant twenty-one years. Afterward he had a large number of
               servants.

               When Joseph sent for Jacob to come into Egypt, the words are,
               "thou and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks and
               thy herds, and ALL THAT THOU HAST." Jacob took his flocks and herds
               but <em>no servants</em>. Gen xlv. 10; xlvii. 6; xlvii. 1. His servants
               doubtless, served under their <em>own contracts</em>, and when Jacob went
               into Egypt, they <em>chose</em> to stay in their own country.

               The government might sell <em>thieves</em>, if they had no property,
               until their services had made good the injury, and paid the legal fine. Ex.
               xxii. 3. But <em>masters</em> seem to have had no power to sell their
               <em>servants</em>&#8212;the reason is obvious. To give the master a
               <em>right</em> to sell his servant, would annihilate the servant's right
               of choice in his own disposal; but says the objector, To give the master a
               right to <em>buy</em> a servant, equally annihilates the servant's
               <em>right of choice</em>. Answer. It is one thing to have a right to buy
               a man, and a very different thing to have a right to buy him of
               <em>another</em> man.

               Though there is no instance of a servant being bought of his, or her
               master, yet there are instances of young females being bought of their
               <em>fathers</em>. But their purchase as <em>servants</em> was their
               betrothal as WIVES. Exodus xxi. 7, 8. "<em>If a man sell his daughter to
                  be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do. If she please
                  not her master</em> WHO HATH BETROTHED HER TO HIMSELF, <em>he shall let

            <p>
               "A Hebrew handmaid might not be sold but to one who laid himself under

               betrothed."&#8212;<em>Maimonides&#8212;Hilcoth&#8212;Obedim</em>,

            </p>
            <p>
               Jarchi, on the same passage, says, "He is bound to espouse her and take her
               to be his wife for the <i>money of her purchase</i> is
               the money of her <i>espousals</i>."

            </p>
            <p>
               7. <em>We infer that the Hebrew servant was voluntary in</em>
               COMMENCING <em>his service, because he was pre-eminently so</em> IN
               CONTINUING <em>it</em>. If, at the year of release, it was the servant's
               <em>choice</em> to remain with his master, so did the law guard his free
               will, that it required his ear to be bored by the judges of the land, thus
               making it impossible for the servant to be held in an involuntary condition.
               Yea, so far was his <em>free choice</em> protected, that his master was
               compelled to keep him, however much he might wish to get rid of him.

               8. <em>The method prescribed for procuring servants, recognized their
                  choice, and was an appeal to it</em>. The Israelites were commanded to
               offer them a suitable <em>inducement</em>, and then leave them to decide.
               They might neither seize by <em>force</em>, nor frighten
               them by <em>threats</em>, nor wheedle them by false pretenses, nor
               <em>borrow</em> them, nor <em>beg</em> them; but they were commanded
               to BUY them<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN8"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN8"></a>; that is, they were to recognize
               the <em>right</em> of the individuals to their own services&#8212;their
               right to <em>dispose</em> of them, and their right to <em>refuse all
                  offers</em>. They might, if they pleased, refuse all applications, and thus
               oblige those who made them, <em>to do their own work</em>. Suppose all,
               with one accord, <em>refused</em> to become servants, what provision did
               the Mosaic law make for such an emergency? NONE.

            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN8"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN8">A</a>: The case of thieves, whose services were
               sold until they had earned enough to make restitution to the person wronged,
               and to pay the legal penalty, <em>stands by itself</em>, and has no
               relation to the condition of servants.
            </p>
            <p>
               9. <em>Various incidental expressions throughout the Bible, corroborate
                  the idea that servants became such by virtue of their own contract</em>. Job
               xli. 4. is an illustration, "<em>Will he</em> (Leviathan)
               <em>make a</em> COVENANT <em>with thee? wilt thou take him for a</em>

            </p>
            <p>
               10. <em>The transaction which made the Egyptians the</em> SERVANTS OF
               PHAROAH, <em>shows entire voluntariness throughout</em>. It is detailed
               in Gen. xlvii. 18-26. Of their own accord, they came to Joseph and said,
               "We have not aught left but our <em>bodies</em> and our lands;
               <em>buy</em> us;" then in the 25th verse, <em>"Thou hast saved our
                  lives: let us find grace in the sight of my Lord, and we will be servants to
                  Pharaoh.</em>"

            <p>
               11. <em>We argue that the condition of servants was an</em> OPTIONAL
               <em>one from the fact that</em> RICH <em>strangers did not become
                  servants.</em> Indeed, so far were they from becoming servants themselves,
               that <em>they bought and held Jewish servants.</em> Lev. xxv. 47.

            </p>
            <p>
               12. <em>The sacrifices and offerings which</em> ALL <em>were required to
                  present, were to be made</em> VOLUNTARILY. Lev. i. 2, 3.

            </p>
            <p>
               13. <em>Mention is often made of persons becoming servants where they
                  were manifestly and pre-eminently</em> VOLUNTARY. The case of the Prophet

               Elisha is one. 1 Kings xix. 21; 2 Kings iii. 11. Elijah was his
               <i>master</i>. The original word, translated master, is
               the same that is so rendered in almost every instance where masters are
               spoken of throughout the Mosaic and patriarchal systems. It is translated
               <i>master</i> eighty-five times in our English version.
               Moses was the servant of Jethro. Exodus iii. 1. Joshua was the servant of
               Moses. Numbers xi. 28. Jacob was the servant of Laban. Genesis xxix, 18-27.

               IV. WERE THE SERVANTS FORCED TO WORK WITHOUT PAY?

            </h3>
            <p>
               Having already shown that the servants became and continued such
               <em>of their own accord</em>, it would be no small marvel if they
               <em>chose</em> to work without pay. Their becoming servants,
               pre-supposes <em>compensation</em> as a motive.

            </p>
            <p>
               That they <em>were paid</em> for their labor, we argue,

            </p>
            <p>
               1. <em>Because, while Israel was under the Mosaic system, God rebuked
                  in thunder, the sin of using the labor of others without wages. "Wo
                  unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers
                  by wrong; that useth his neighbor's service without wages, and giveth
                  him not for his work.</em>" Jer. xxii. 13. Here God testifies that to use
               the service of others without wages is "unrighteousness," and He
               commissions his "wo" to burn upon the doer of the "wrong." This
               "wo" was a permanent safeguard of the <i>Mosaic
                  system</i>. The Hebrew word
               <i>Rea</i>, here
               translated <i>neighbor</i>, does not mean one man, or
               class of men, in distinction from others, but <em>any one with whom we have
                  to do</em>&#8212;all descriptions of persons, not merely servants and heathen,
               but even those who prosecute us in lawsuits, and enemies while in the act of
               fighting us&#8212;"<em>As when a man riseth against his</em> NEIGHBOR
               <em>and slayeth him.</em>" Deut. xxii. 26.
               "<em>Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the
                  end thereof, when thy</em> NEIGHBOR <em>hath put thee to shame.</em>"
               Prov. xxv. 8. "<em>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy</em>
               NEIGHBOR." Exod. xx. 16. "<em>If any man come presumptuously
                  upon his NEIGHBOR to slay him with guile</em>." Exod. xxi. 14. In these, and
               in scores of similar cases, <i>Rea</i>
               is the original word.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. <em>We have the testimony of God, that in our duty to our fellow
                  men,</em> ALL THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS <em>hang upon this command,
                  "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</em>" Our Saviour, in giving this
               command, quoted <i>verbatim</i> one of
               the laws of the Mosaic system. Lev. xix. 18. In the 34th verse of the same
               chapter, Moses commands obedience to this law in all the treatment of
               strangers, "<em>The stranger that

                  dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and</em> THOU
               SHALT LOVE HIM AS THYSELF." If it be loving others <em>as</em> ourselves,
               to make them work for us without pay; to rob them of food and clothing,
               as well as wages, would be a stranger illustration still of the law of
               love! Super-disinterested benevolence! And if it be doing to others
               as we would have them do to us, to make them work for <em>our own</em>
               good alone, Paul should be called to order for his hard sayings against human
               nature, especially for that libellous matter in Ephes. v. 29, "<em>No man
                  ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               3. <em>As persons became servants</em> FROM POVERTY, <em>we argue that
                  they were compensated, since they frequently owned property, and sometimes
                  a large amount</em>. Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, gave David a
               princely present, "An hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches
               of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine." 2
               Sam. xvi. 1. The extent of his possessions can be inferred from the
               fact, that though the father of fifteen sons, he still employed twenty
               servants, of whom he was the master.

            </p>
            <p>
               A case is stated in Leviticus xxv. 47-55, where a servant, reduced
               to poverty, sells himself; and it is declared that afterward he may be
               <i>redeemed</i>, either by his kindred, or by HIMSELF.
               As he was forced to sell himself from sheer poverty he must not only have
               acquired property <em>after</em> he became a servant, but a considerable
               sum.

            </p>
            <p>
               If it had not been common for servants to possess, and acquire property,
               over which they had the exclusive control, Gehazi, the servant
               of Elisha, would hardly have ventured to take a large sum of money,
               (nearly $3000<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN9"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN9"></a>) from Naaman,
               (2 Kings v. 22, 23.) As it was procured
               by deceit, he was anxious to conceal the means used in getting
               it; but if the Israelitish servants, like our slaves, could "own nothing,
               nor acquire any thing," to embark in such an enterprise would have been
               consummate stupidity. The fact of having in his possession two talents of
               silver, would of itself convict him of theft<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN10"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN10"></a>. But since the
               possession and use of property by servants, was common under the Mosaic
               system,

               he might have it, and invest or use it, without attracting special attention.
               And that consideration alone would have been a strong motive to the act. His
               master, while he rebukes him for using such means to get the money, not only
               does not take it from him, but seems to expect that he would invest it in real
               estate, and cattle, and would procure servants with it. 2 Kings v. 26. In
               1 Sam. ix. 8, we find the servant of Saul having money, and relieving his
               master in an emergency. Arza, the servant of Elah, was the <em>owner of a
                  house</em>. That it was spacious and somewhat magnificent, would be a
               natural inference from the fact that it was a resort of the king. 1 Kings xvi.
               9. The case of the Gibeonites, who, after they became servants, still
               occupied their cities, and remained, in many respects, a distinct people for
               centuries; and that of the 150,000 Canaanites, the
               <em>servants</em> of Solomon, who worked out their tribute of bond-service
               in levies, periodically relieving each other, while preparing the materials
               for the temple, are additional illustrations of independence in the
               acquisition and ownership of property.

               decide with accuracy upon the <em>relative</em> value of that sum,
               <em>then</em> and <em>now</em>, yet we have enough to warrant us in
               saying that two talents of silver had far more value <em>then</em> than

               heard of the slaves in our southern states stealing a large amount of money?
               They "<em>know how to take care of themselves</em>" quite too well for
               that. When they steal, they are careful to do it on such a <em>small</em>
               scale, or in the taking of <em>such things</em> as will make detection
               difficult. No doubt they steal now and then a little, and a gaping marvel
               would it be if they did not. Why should they not follow in the footsteps of
               their masters and mistresses? Dull scholars indeed! if, after so many lessons
               from <i>proficients</i> in the art, who drive the business
               by <i>wholesale</i>, they should not occasionally copy
               their betters, fall into the <i>fashion</i>, and try their
               hand in a small way, at a practice which is the <em>only permanent and
                  universal</em> business carried on around them!
               Ignoble truly! never to feel the stirrings of high impulse, prompting them to
               imitate the eminent pattern set before them in the daily vocation of
               "Honorables" and "Excellencies," and to emulate the illustrious examples of

               Hear President Jefferson's testimony. In his notes of Virginia, speaking of
               slaves, he says, "That disposition to theft with which they (the slaves) have
               been branded, must be ascribed to their <em>situation</em>, and not to
               any special depravity of the moral sense. It is a problem which I give the
               master to solve, whether the religious precepts against the violation of
               property were not framed for HIM as well as for his slave&#8212;and whether

               4. <i>Heirship</i>&#8212;Servants frequently inherited
               their master's property; especially if he had no sons, or if they had
               dishonored the family. This seems to have been a general usage.

               The cases of Eliezer, the servant of Abraham; Ziba, the servant of
               Mephibosheth, Jarha an Egyptian, the servant of Sheshan, and the husband of
               his daughter; 1 Chron. ii. 34, 35, and of the <em>husbandmen</em> who
               said of their master's son, "<em>this is the</em> HEIR, let us kill him,
               <em>and</em> the INHERITANCE WILL BE OURS." Mark xii. 7, are
               illustrations. Also the declaration in Prov. xvii. 2&#8212;"<em>A wise
                  servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and</em> SHALL HAVE
               PART OF THE INHERITANCE AMONG THE BRETHREN." This passage seems to give
               <em>servants</em> precedence as heirs, even over the <em>wives</em>
               and <em>daughters</em> of their masters. Did masters hold by force, and
               <em>plunder of earnings</em>, a class of persons, from which, in frequent
               contingencies, they selected both heirs for their property, and husbands for
               their daughters?

                  provided by law with a large stock of provisions and cattle</em>. Deut. xv.
               11-14. "<em>Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock,
                  and out of thy floor, and out of thy wine press, of that wherewith the Lord
                  thy God hath blessed thee, thou shalt give
                  him</em><a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN11"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN11"></a>." If it be objected, that no mention
               is made of the servants from the strangers, receiving a like bountiful
               supply, we answer, neither did the most honorable class of the
               <em>Israelitish</em> servants, the free-holders; and for the same reason,
               <em>they did not go out in the seventh year</em>, but continued until
               the jubilee. If the fact that no mention is made of the Gentile servants
               receiving such a <i>gratuity</i> proves that they were
               robbed of their <em>earnings</em>; it proves that the most valued class
               of <em>Hebrew</em> servants were robbed of theirs also, a conclusion
               too stubborn for even pro-slavery masticators, however unscrupulous.

                  compensation for their services in advance</em>. Having shown, under a
               previous head, that servants <em>sold themselves</em>, and of course
               received the compensation for themselves, (except in cases where parents hired
               out the time of their children until they became of
               age<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN12"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN12"></a>,) a mere reference to the fact in

                  time having a large number of servants, and afterwards none, without any
                  intimation that they were sold.</em> The wages of servants would enable
               them to set up in business for themselves. Jacob, after being the servant
               of Laban for twenty-one years, became thus an independent herdsman, and was
               the master of many servants. Gen. xxx. 43, and xxxii.
               15. But all these servants had left him before he went down into
               Egypt, having doubtless acquired enough to commence business for
               themselves. Gen. xlv. 10, 11, and xlvi. 1-7, 32.

               9. <em>God's testimony to the character of Abraham.</em> Genesis xviii.
               19.
               <em>"For I know him that he will command his children and his household
                  after him, and they shall keep</em> THE WAY OF THE LORD TO DO JUSTICE AND
               JUDGMENT." We have here God's testimony, that Abraham taught his servants
               "the way of the Lord." What was the "way of the Lord" respecting the payment
               of wages where service was rendered? "<em>Wo unto him that useth his
                  neighbor's service without wages</em>!" Jer. xxii. 13.
               "<em>Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal</em>."
               Col. iv. 1. <em>"Render unto all their</em> DUES." ROM. xiii. 7.
               <em>"The laborer is worthy of his hire."</em> Luke x. 7. How did Abraham
               teach his servants to <em>"do justice"</em> to others? By doing
               <em>injustice to them?</em> Did he exhort them to "render to all their
               dues" by keeping back <em>their own</em>? Did he teach them that "the
               laborer was worthy of his hire" by robbing them of <em>theirs</em>? Did
               he beget in them a reverence for the eighth commandment by pilfering all
               their time and labor? Did he teach them "not to defraud" others "in any
               matter" by denying <em>them</em> "what was just and equal?" If each of
               Abraham's pupils under such a catechism did not become a very
               <i>Aristides</i> in justice, then an illustrious example,
               patriarchal dignity, and <em>practical</em> lessons, can make but slow
               headway against human perverseness!

               10. <em>Specific precepts of the Mosaic law enforcing general
                  principles.</em> Out of many, we select the following:

            </p>
            <p>
               (1.) <em>"Thou shall not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn,"</em>
               or literally, <em>while he thresheth.</em> Deut. xxv. 4. Here is a
               general principle applied to a familiar case. The ox representing all
               domestic animals. Isaiah xxx. 24. A <em>particular</em> kind of
               service&#8212;<em>all</em> kinds; and a law requiring an abundant
               provision for the wants of an animal ministering to man in a
               <em>certain</em> way,&#8212;<em>a general principle of treatment
                  covering all times, modes, and instrumentalities of service.</em> The
               object of the law was, not merely to enjoin tenderness towards brutes, but to
               inculcate the duty of <em>rewarding those who serve us</em>, showing that
               they who labor for others, are entitled to what is just and equal in return;
               and if such care is enjoined, by God, not merely for the ample sustenance,
               but for the <em>present enjoyment of a brute</em>, what would be a meet
               return for the services of <em>man</em>? MAN, with his varied wants,
               exalted nature and immortal destiny! Paul tells us expressly, that the
               principle which we have named, lies at the bottom of the statute. See
               1 Corinthians ix. 9, 10&#8212;<em>"For it is written in the law of Moses,
                  Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth
                  God take care for oxen? Or saith he it altogether for OUR sakes? that he that
                  ploweth should plow in</em>
               HOPE, <em>and that he that thresheth in hope should be</em> PARTAKER OF
               HIS HOPE."

            </p>
            <p>
               (2.) "<em>If thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee,
                  then thou shalt relieve him.</em> YEA, THOUGH HE BE A STRANGER OR a
               SOJOURNER, <em>that he may live with thee. Take thou no usury of him,
                  or increase, but fear thy God. Thou shalt not give him thy money upon
                  usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.</em>" Lev. xxv. 35-37. Or,
               in other words, "relief at your hands is his right, and your duty&#8212;you
               shall not take advantage of his necessities, but cheerfully supply them."
               Now, we ask, by what process of pro-slavery legerdemain, this benevolent
               regulation can be made to be in <em>keeping</em> with the doctrine of
               WORK WITHOUT PAY? Did God declare the poor stranger entitled to RELIEF,
               and in the same breath, <em>authorize</em> them to <em>"use his
                  services without wages</em>;" force him to work, and ROB HIM OF ALL HIS
               EARNINGS? Judge ye.

               Cases are recorded to which creditors took from debtors property of
               all kinds, to satisfy their demands. In Job xxiv. 3, cattle are taken;
               in Prov. xxii 27, household furniture; in Lev. xxv. 25-28, the productions

               (2.) <em>Servants were never given as pledges</em>. <em>Property</em>
               of all sorts was given and held in pledge. We find in the Bible, household
               furniture, clothing, cattle, money, signets, and personal ornaments, with
               divers other articles of property, used as pledges for value received. But no

            <p>
               (4.) <em>The Israelites never gave away their servants as presents</em>.
               They made princely presents of great variety. Lands, houses, all kinds of
               animals, merchandize, family utensils, precious metals, and grain, armor,
               &amp;c. are among their recorded <em>gifts</em>. Giving presents to
               superiors and persons of rank when visiting them, and at other times, was a
               standing usage. 1 Sam. x. 27; 1 Sam. xvi. 20; 2 Chron. xvii. 5. Abraham

               1 Kings xiv. 3; Asa to Benhadad, 1 Kings xv. 18, 19. But no
               servants were given as presents&#8212;though that was a prevailing fashion
               in the surrounding nations. Gen. xii. 16; Gen. xx. 14.

               OBJECTION 1. <em>Laban</em> GAVE <em>handmaids to his daughters, Jacob's
                  wives</em>. Without enlarging on the nature of the polygamy then prevalent,
               it is enough to say that the handmaids of wives, at that time, were
               themselves regarded as wives, though of inferior dignity and authority.
               That Jacob so regarded his handmaids, is proved by his curse upon Reuben,
               (Gen. xlix. 4, and Chron. v. 1) also by the equality of their children
               with those of Rachel and Leah. But had it been otherwise&#8212;had Laban given
               them <em>as articles of property</em>, then, indeed, the example of
               this "good old patriarch and slaveholder," Saint Laban, would have

               clan, and plunged over the desert in hot pursuit, seven days, by forced
               marches; how he ransacked a whole caravan, sifting the contents of

               If that proves <em>servants</em> property, it proves <em>wives</em>
               property. "<em>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not
                  covet thy neighbor's</em> WIFE, <em>nor his man servant, nor his
                  maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy
                  neighbor's</em>" EXODUS xx. 17. An examination of

               all the places in which servants are included among beasts, chattels,
               &amp;c., will show, that in inventories of <em>mere property</em>,
               servants are not included, or if included, it is in such a way, as to show
               that they are not regarded as <em>property</em>. Eccl. ii. 7, 8. But when
               the design is to show, not merely the wealth but the <em>greatness</em>
               of any personage, that he is a man of distinction, a ruler, a prince,
               servants are spoken of, as well as property. In a word, if
               <em>riches</em> alone are spoken of, no mention is made of servants; if
               <em>greatness</em>, servants and property. Gen. xiii. 2. <em>"And
                  Abraham was very rich in cattle, in silver and in gold."</em> No mention
               of <em>servants</em>. So in the fifth verse; Lot's riches are enumerated,
               "<em>And Lot also had flocks, and herds, and tents</em>." In the seventh
               verse servants are mentioned, "<em>And there was a strife between the</em>
               HERDMEN <em>of Abraham's cattle and the</em> HERDMEN <em>of Lot's
                  cattle</em>". See also Josh. xxii. 8; Gen. xxxiv. 23; Job. xlii. 12;
               2 Chron. xxi. 3; xxxii. 27-29; Job 1. 3-5; Deut. viii. 12-17; Gen. xxiv. 35,
               and xxvi. 13, and xxx. 43.

            </p>
            <p>
               Divers facts dropped incidentally, show that when servants are mentioned in
               connection with property, it is in such a way as to <em>distinguish</em>
               them from it. When Jacob was about to leave Laban, his wives say, "All the
               <em>riches</em> which thou hast taken from our father, that is ours and
               our children's." Then follows an inventory of property. "All his cattle," "all
               his goods," "the cattle of his getting," &amp;c. He had a large number of
               servants at the time, <em>but they are not included with his
                  property</em>. Compare Gen. xxx. 43, with Gen. xxxi. 16-18.

               When he sent messengers to Esau, in order to secure his respect, and impress
               him with an idea of his state and sway, he bade them tell him not only of
               <i>his</i> RICHES, but of his GREATNESS; that Jacob had
               "<em>oxen, and asses, and flocks, and men servants, and maid
                  servants</em>." Gen. xxxii. 4, 5. Yet in the present which he sent, there
               were no servants; though he seems to have aimed to give it as much variety as
               possible. Gen. xxxii. 14, 15; see also Gen. xxxvi. 6, 7; Gen. xxxiv. 23. As
               flocks and herds were the <em>staples</em> of wealth, a large number of
               servants <em>presupposed</em> large possessions of cattle, which would
               require many herdsmen. Further. When servants are spoken of in connection with
               <em>mere property</em>, the terms used to express the latter do not
               include the former.

               The Hebrew word <i>Mickna</i> is an
               illustration. It is a derivative of
               <i>Kana</i>, to procure, to buy, and its
               meaning is, a <em>possession, wealth, riches</em>. It occurs more than
               forty times in the Old Testament&#8212;and is applied always to <em>mere
                  property</em>&#8212;generally to domestic animals,

               but <em>never</em> to servants. In some instances, servants are mentioned
               in <em>distinction</em> from the
               <i>Mickna.</i> See Gen. xii. 5.
               <em>"And Abraham took Sarah his wife, and Lot his brother's son. And all
                  their</em> SUBSTANCE <em>that they had gathered, and the souls that they
                  had gotten in Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of
                  Canaan</em>." <em>Substance gathered</em> and <em>souls gotten</em>!
               Many will have it, that these <em>souls</em> were a part of Abraham's
               <em>substance</em> (notwithstanding the pains here taken to separate them
               from it)&#8212;that they were <em>slaves</em>&#8212;probably captives in
               war, and now, by right of conquest, taken with him in his migration as part of
               his family effects. Who but slaveholders, either actually, or in heart, would
               torture into the principle and practice of slavery, such a harmless phrase as
               "<em>the souls that they had gotten</em>?" Until the slave trade breathed
               its haze upon the vision of the church, and smote her with palsy and decay,
               commentators saw no slavery in, "The souls that they had gotten."
               In the Targum of Onkelos<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN13"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN13"></a> it is thus rendered, "The
               souls whom they had brought to obey the law in Haran." In the Targum of
               Jonathan, thus: "The souls whom they had made proselytes in Haran." In the
               Targum of Jerusalem, "The souls proselyted in Haran." Jarchi, placed by
               Jewish Rabbis at the head of their commentators, thus renders it: "The souls
               whom they had brought under the Divine wings." Jerome, one of the most learned
               of the Christian fathers: "The persons whom they had proselyted." The Persian
               version thus gives the whole verse, "And Abraham took Sarah his wife, and Lot
               his brother's son, and all their wealth which they had accumulated, and
               the souls which they had <em>made</em>." The Vulgate version thus
               translates it, "Universam substantiam quam possederant et animas quas fecerant
               in Haran." "The entire wealth which they possessed, and the souls
               which they had made." The Syriac thus, "All their possessions which
               they possessed, and the souls which they had made in Haran." The
               Arabic, "All their property which they had acquired, and the souls
               whom they had made in Haran." The Samarian, "All the wealth
               which they had gathered, and the souls which they had made in
               Haran." Menochius, a commentator who wrote before our present
               translation of the English Bible, renders it as follows:&#8212;"Quas de
               idolotraria

               ago. "Quas legi subjicerant."&#8212;"Those whom they had brought to obey the

               was probably made at about the commencement of the Christian era. The Targum

               <em>"Now I say unto you, that the heir, so long as he is a child,</em>

               with great affection by the household, and that the utmost confidence
               was reposed in them, is shown in the arming of 318 of them for the recovery

               When Abraham's servant went to Padanaram, the young Princess

               and "she hasted and emptied her pitcher, and ran again unto the well,

               In the 9th chapter of 1 Samuel, we have an account of a high festival in the
               city of Zuph, at which Samuel, the chief judge and ruler in
               Israel, presided. None sat down at the feast but those that were bidden.
               And only "about <em>thirty</em> persons" were invited. Quite a select
               party!&#8212;the elite of the city of Zuph! Saul and his servant arrived at
               Zuph just as the party was assembling; and <em>both</em> of them, at
               Samuel's solicitation, accompany him as invited guests. <em>"And Samuel
                  took Saul and his</em> SERVANT, <em>and brought</em> THEM
               <em>into the</em> PARLOR(!) <i>and made</i> THEM
               <em>sit in the</em> CHIEFEST SEATS <em>among those that were
                  bidden."</em> A <em>servant</em> invited by the chief judge, ruler, and
               prophet in Israel, to dine publicly with a select party, in company with his
               master, who was
               <em>at the same time anointed King of Israel</em>; and this servant
               introduced by Samuel into the PARLOR, and assigned, with his master, to the
               <em>chiefest seat</em> at the table! This was "<em>one</em> of the

               or the <em>chief</em> of them&#8212;not at all a <em>picked</em>
               man, but "<em>one</em> of the servants;" <em>any</em> one that could
               be most easily spared, as no endowments specially rare would be likely to find

               entertainment, in the house of Arza, his steward, or head servant, with whom
               he seems to have been on terms of familiarity. Without detailing other

               3. <em>The condition of the Gibeonites, as subjects of the Hebrew
                  commonwealth, shows that they were neither articles of property, nor
                  even</em> INVOLUNTARY <em>servants</em>. The condition of the
               inhabitants of Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim, under the
               Israelites, is quoted in triumph by the advocates of slavery; and truly they
               are right welcome to all the crumbs that can be gleaned from it. Milton's
               devils made desperate snatches at fruit that turned to ashes on their lips.
               The spirit of slavery raves under tormenting gnawings, and casts about in
               blind phrenzy for something to ease, or even to <em>mock</em> them. But
               for this, it would never have clutched at the Gibeonites, for even the
               incantations of the demon cauldron, could not extract from their case enough
               to tantalize starvation's self. But to the question. What was the condition
               of the Gibeonites under the Israelites?

            </p>
            <p>
               (1.) <em>It was voluntary</em>. It was their own proposition to Joshua to
               become servants. Joshua ix. 8, 11. Their proposition was accepted, but
               the kind of service which they should perform, was not specified until
               their gross imposition came to light; they were then assigned to menial
               offices in the tabernacle.

            </p>
            <p>
               (2.) <em>They were not domestic servants in the families of the
                  Israelites</em>. They still continued to reside in their own cities,
               cultivating their own fields, tending their flocks and herds, and exercising
               the functions of a <em>distinct</em>, though not independent community.
               They were <em>subject</em> to the Jewish nation as
               <em>tributaries</em>. So far from being distributed among the Israelites,
               their family relations broken up, and their internal organization as a
               distinct people abolished, they seem to have remained a separate, and, in
               some respects, an independent community for many

               centuries. When they were attacked by the Amorites, they applied to
               the Israelites as confederates for aid&#8212;it was promptly rendered, their
               enemies routed, and themselves left unmolested in the occupation of
               their cities, while all Israel returned to Gilgal. Joshua x. 6-18. Long
               afterwards, Saul slew some of them, and God sent upon Israel a three
               years' famine for it. David said to the Gibeonites, "What shall I do
               for you, and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless
               the inheritance of the Lord?" At their demand, he delivered up to
               them, seven of the royal family, five of them the sons of Michal, his own
               former wife. 2 Samuel xxi. 1-9. The whole transaction was a formal
               recognition of the Gibeonites as a separate people. There is no intimation
               that they served families, or individuals of the Israelites, but only
               the "house of God," or the Tabernacle. This was established first at
               Gilgal, a day's journey from the cities of the Gibeonites; and then at
               Shiloh, nearly two days' journey from them; where it continued about
               350 years. During all this period, the Gibeonites inhabited their ancient
               cities and territory. Only a few, comparatively, could have been absent
               from their cities at any one time in attendance on the tabernacle.

            </p>
            <p>
               (1.) Whenever allusion is made to them in the history, the main body
               are spoken of as <em>at home</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               (2.) It is preposterous to suppose that their tabernacle services could
               have furnished employment for all the inhabitants of these four cities.
               One of them "was a great city, as one of the royal cities;" so large,
               that a confederacy of five kings, apparently the most powerful in the
               land, was deemed necessary for its destruction. It is probable that the
               men were divided into classes, and thus ministered at the tabernacle in
               rotation&#8212;each class a few days or weeks at a time. This service was
               their <em>national tribute</em> to the Israelites, rendered for the
               privilege of residence and protection under their government. No service
               seems to have been required of the <em>females</em>. As these Gibeonites
               were Canaanites, and as they had greatly exasperated the Israelites by
               impudent imposition, hypocrisy, and lying, we might assuredly expect that
               they would reduce <em>them</em> to the condition of chattels and property,
               if there was <em>any</em> case in which God permitted them to do so.

            </p>
         </div>
         <p>
            7. <em>Because, throughout the Mosaic system, God warns them against
               holding their servants in such a condition as they were held in by the
               Egyptians</em>. How often are the Israelites pointed back to the grindings
            of their prison-house! What motives to the exercise of justice and
            kindness towards their servants, are held out to their fears in threatened
            judgements; to their hopes in promised good; and to all within them

            that could feel, by those oft repeated words of tenderness and terror!
            "For ye were bondmen in the land of Egypt"&#8212;waking anew the memory
            of tears and anguish, and of the wrath that avenged them.

         </p>
         <p>
            That the argument derived from the condition of the Israelites in
            Egypt, and God's condemnation of it, may be appreciated, it is important
            that the Egyptian bondage should be analyzed. We shall then be
            able to ascertain, of what rights the Israelites were plundered, and what
            they retained.

            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN17"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN17">B</a>: The land of Goshen was a large tract of
               country, east of the Pelusian arm of the Nile, and between it and the head of
               the Red Sea, and the lower border of Palestine. The probable centre of that
               portion, occupied by the Israelites, could hardly, have been less than 60
               miles from the city. From the best authorities it would seem that the extreme
               western boundary of Goshen must have been many miles distant from Egypt. See
               "Exodus of the Israelites out of Egypt," an able article by Professor
               Robinson, in the Biblical Repository for October, 1832.

               (3.) <em>They lived in permanent dwellings</em>. These were
               <em>houses</em>, not <em>tents</em>. In Ex. xii. 6, the two side
               <em>posts</em>, and the upper door <em>posts</em> of the houses are
               mentioned, and in the 22d, the two side posts and the lintel. Each family
               seems to have occupied a house <em>by itself</em>&#8212;Acts
               vii. 20, Ex. xii. 4&#8212;and from the regulation about the eating of the
               Passover, they could hardly have been small ones&#8212;Ex. xii. 4&#8212;and
               probably contained separate apartments, and places for seclusion. Ex. ii. 2,
               3; Acts vii. 20. They appear to have been well apparelled. Ex. xii.
               11. To have had their own burial grounds. Ex. xiii. 19, and xiv. 11.

            </p>
            <p>
               (4.) <em>They owned "a mixed multitude of flocks and herds</em>," and
               "<i>very much cattle</i>." Ex. xii. 32, 37, 38.

            </p>
            <p>
               (5.) They had their own form of government, and preserved their
               tribe and family divisions, and their internal organization throughout,
               though still a province of Egypt, and <em>tributary</em> to it. Ex. ii. 1,
               and xii. 19, 21, and vi. 14, 25, and v. 19, and iii. 16, 18.

            </p>
            <p>
               (6.) <em>They seem to have had in a considerable measure, the disposal
                  of their own time</em>,&#8212;Ex. xxiii. 4, and iii. 16, 18, and xii. 6,
               and ii. 9,

               and iv. 27, 29-31. Also to have practised the fine arts. Ex. xxxii.
               4, and xxxv. 32-35.

            </p>
            <p>
               (7.) <em>They were all armed</em>. Ex. xxxii. 27.

            </p>
            <p>
               (8.) <em>All the females seem to have known something of domestic
                  refinements; they were familiar with instruments of music, and skilled in
                  the working of fine fabrics</em>. Ex. xv. 20, and 35, 36.

            </p>
            <p>
               (9.) <em>They held their possessions independently, and the Egyptians
                  seem to have regarded them as inviolable</em>. This we infer from the fact
               that there is no intimation that the Egyptians dispossessed them of their
               habitations, or took away their flocks, or herds, or crops, or implements
               of agriculture, or any article of property.

               (10.) <em>Service seems to have been exacted from none but adult
                  males</em>. Nothing is said from which the bond service of females could be
               inferred; the hiding of Moses three months by his mother, and the payment
               of wages to her by Pharaoh's daughter, go against such a supposition.
               Ex. ii. 29.

            </p>
            <p>
               (11.) So far from being fed upon a given allowance, their food was
               abundant, and had great variety. "They sat by the flesh-pots," and
               "did eat bread to the full." Ex. xvi. 3, and xxiv. 1, and xvii. 5, and
               iv. 29, and vi. 14. Also, "they did eat fish freely, and cucumbers,
               and melons, and leeks, and onions, and garlic." Num. xi. 4, 5, and x.
               18, and xx. 5.

            </p>
            <p>
               (12.) <em>That the great body of the people were not in the service of the
                  Egyptians, we infer</em> (1) from the fact, that the extent and variety of
               their own possessions, together with such a cultivation of their crops as
               would provide them with bread, and such care of their immense flocks
               and herds, as would secure their profitable increase, must have furnished
               constant employment for the main body of the nation.

            </p>
            <p>
               (2.) During the plague of darkness, God informs us that "ALL the
               children of Israel had light in their dwellings." We infer that they
               were <em>there</em> to enjoy it.

            </p>
            <p>
               (3.) It seems improbable that the making of brick, the only service
               named during the latter part of their sojourn in Egypt, could have furnished
               permanent employment for the bulk of the nation. See also
               Ex. iv. 29-31.

            </p>
            <p>
               Besides, when Eastern nations employed tributaries, it was, as now,
               in the use of the levy, requiring them to furnish a given quota, drafted
               off periodically, so that comparatively but a small portion of the nation
               would be absent <em>at any one time</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               Probably there was the same requisition upon the Israelites for one-fifth
               part of the proceeds of their labor, that was laid upon the Egyptians.
               See Gen. xlvii. 24, 26. Instead of taking it out of their <em>crops</em>,
               (Goshen being better for <em>pasturage</em> than crops) they exacted it of
               them in brick making; and it is quite probable that only the
               <em>poorer</em> Israelites were required to work for the Egyptians at all,
               the wealthier being able to pay their tribute, in money. See Exod. iv. 27-31.

            </p>
            <p>
               This was the bondage in Egypt. Contrast it with American slavery.
               Have our slaves "very much cattle," and "a mixed multitude of flocks
               and herds?" Do they live in commodious houses of their own? Do
               they "<em>sit by the flesh-pots</em>," "<em>eat fish freely</em>,"
               and "<em>eat bread to the full</em>?" Do they live in a separate
               community, at a distance from their masters, in their distinct tribes, under
               their own rulers and officers? Have they the exclusive occupation of an
               extensive and fertile tract of country for the culture of their own crops, and
               for rearing immense herds of <em>their own</em> cattle&#8212;and all these
               held independently of their masters, and regarded by them as inviolable? Are
               our female slaves free from all exactions of labor and liabilities of
               outrage?&#8212;and whenever employed, are they paid wages, as was the
               Israelitish woman, when employed by the king's daughter? Exod. ii. 9. Have
               the females entirely, and the males to a considerable extent, the disposal of
               their own time? Have they the means for cultivating social refinements,
               for practising the fine arts, and for intellectual and moral improvement?

            </p>
            <p>
               THE ISRAELITES, UNDER THE BONDAGE OF EGYPT, ENJOYED ALL THESE RIGHTS AND
               PRIVILEGES. True, "<em>their lives were made bitter, and all the service
                  wherein they made them serve was with rigor</em>." But what was that, when
               compared with the incessant toil of American slaves, the robbery of all their
               time and earnings, and even the "power to own any thing, or acquire any
               thing"&#8212;the "quart of corn a day," the legal allowance of
               food<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN18"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN18"></a>!&#8212;their <em>only</em> clothing for one half the year,

               pantaloons<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN19"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN19"></a>!"&#8212;the <em>two hours and a half</em> only for rest and
               refreshment in the twenty-four<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN20"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN20"></a>!&#8212;their dwellings, <em>hovels</em>,
               unfit for human residence, commonly with but one apartment, where
               both sexes and all ages herd promiscuously at night, like the beasts of

               the field. Add to this, the mental ignorance, and moral degradation;
               the daily separations of kindred, the revelries of lust, the lacerations
               and baptisms of blood, sanctioned by the laws of the South, and patronized
               by its pubic sentiment. What, we ask, was the bondage of Egypt
               when compared with this? And yet for <em>her</em> oppression of the poor,
               God smote her with plagues, and trampled her as the mire, till she
               passed away in his wrath, and the place that knew her in her pride,
               knew her no more. Ah! "<em>I have seen the afflictions of my people, and
                  I have heard their groanings, and am come down to deliver them</em>." HE
               DID COME, and Egypt sank, a ruinous heap, and her blood closed over
               her.

               Let those believe who can, that God gave his people permission to
               hold human beings, robbed of <em>all</em> their rights, while he
               threatened them with wrath to the uttermost, if they practised the
               <em>far lighter</em> oppression of Egypt&#8212;which robbed its victims
               of only the <em>least</em> and <em>cheapest</em> of their rights, and
               left the <em>females</em> unplundered even of these. What! <em>Is God
                  divided against himself</em>? When he had just turned Egypt into
               a funeral pile; while his curse yet blazed upon her unburied dead, and
               his bolts still hissed amidst her slaughter, and the smoke of her torment
               went upwards because she had "ROBBED THE POOR," did He license the
               VICTIMS of robbery to rob the poor of ALL? As <em>Lawgiver</em>, did he
               <em>create</em> a system tenfold more grinding than that, for which he had
               just hurled Pharaoh headlong, and cloven down his princes, and overwhelmed his
               hosts, and blasted them with His thunder, till "hell was moved to meet
               them at their coming?"

               The advocates of slavery are always at their wits end when they
               try to press the Bible into their service. Every movement shows that
               they are hard-pushed. Their odd conceits and ever varying shifts, their
               forced constructions, lacking even plausibility, their bold assumptions,
               and blind guesswork, not only proclaim their <em>cause</em> desperate, but
               themselves. Some of the Bible defences thrown around slavery by
               ministers of the Gospel, do so torture common sense, Scripture, and
               historical fact, that it were hard to tell whether absurdity, fatuity,
               ignorance, or blasphemy, predominates, in compound. Each strives so
               lustily for the mastery, it may be set down a drawn battle.

               How often has it been set up in type, that the color of the negro is
               the <em>Cain-mark</em>, propagated downward. Doubtless Cain's posterity
               started an opposition to the ark, and rode out the flood with flying
               streamers! Why should not a miracle be wrought to point such an argument, and
               fill out for slaveholders a Divine title-deed, vindicating the ways of God
               to men?

               OBJECTION 1. "<em>Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be
                  unto his brethren</em>." Gen. i. 25.

            </p>
            <p>
               This prophecy of Noah is the vade mecum of
               slaveholders, and they never venture abroad without it. It is a pocket-piece
               for sudden occasion&#8212;a keepsake to dote over&#8212;a charm to spell-bind
               opposition, and a magnet to attract "whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh
               a lie." But closely as they cling to it, "cursed be Canaan" is a poor drug to
               stupify a throbbing conscience&#8212;a mocking lullaby, vainly wooing slumber
               to unquiet tossings, and crying "Peace, be still," where God wakes
               war, and breaks his thunders.

            </p>
            <p>
               Those who plead the curse on Canaan to justify negro slavery,
               <em>assume</em> all the points in debate.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. That the condition prophesied was <em>slavery</em>, rather than the
               mere <em>rendering of service</em> to others, and that it was the bondage
               of <em>individuals</em> rather than the condition of a <em>nation
                  tributary</em> to another, and in <em>that</em> sense its
               <em>servant</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. That the <em>prediction</em> of crime <em>justifies</em> it; that
               it grants absolution to those whose crimes fulfil it, if it does not transform
               the crimes into <em>virtues</em>. How piously the Pharaohs might have
               quoted God's prophecy to Abraham, "<em>Thy seed shall be in bondage, and
                  they shall afflict them for four hundred years</em>." And then, what
               <em>saints</em> were those that crucified the Lord of glory!

            </p>
            <p>
               3. That the Africans are descended from Canaan. Whereas Africa
               was peopled from Egypt and Ethiopia, and Mizraim settled Egypt, and
               Cush, Ethiopia. See Gen. x. 15-19, for the location and boundaries
               of Canaan's posterity. So on the assumption that African slavery fulfils
               the prophecy, a curse pronounced upon one people, is quoted to
               justify its infliction upon another. Perhaps it may be argued that Canaan
               includes all Ham's posterity. If so, the prophecy has not been
               fulfilled. The other sons of Ham settled the Egyptian and Assyrian
               empires, and conjointly with Shem the Persian, and afterward, to some
               extent, the Grecian and Roman. The history of these nations gives
               no verification of the prophecy. Whereas the history of Canaan's descendants,
               for more than three thousand years, is a record of its fulfilment.
               First, they were made tributaries by the Israelites. Then Canaan
               was the servant of Shem. Afterward, by the Medes and Persians.
               Then Canaan was the servant of Shem, and in part of the other sons of
               Ham. Afterward, by the Macedonians, Grecians, and Romans, successively.
               Then Canaan was the servant of Japhet, mainly, and secondarily
               of the other sons of Ham. Finally, they were subjected by
               the Ottoman dynasty, where they yet remain. Thus Canaan is <em>now</em>
               the servant of Shem and Japhet and the other sons of Ham.

            </p>
            <p>
               But it may still be objected, that though Canaan is the only one
               <em>named</em> in the curse, yet the 22d and 23d verses show that it was
               pronounced upon the posterity of Ham in general. "<em>And Ham, the father of
                  Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren
                  without</em>."&#8212;Verse 22. In verse 23, Shem and Japhet cover their
               father with a garment. Verse 24, "<em>And Noah awoke from his wine, and
                  knew what his YOUNGER son had done unto him, and said</em>," &amp;c.

               It is argued that this younger son cannot be <em>Canaan</em>, as he was
               not the <em>son</em>, but the <em>grandson</em> of Noah, and therefore
               it must be <em>Ham</em>. We answer, whoever that "<em>younger
                  son</em>" was, or whatever he did, <em>Canaan</em> alone was named in
               the curse. Besides, the Hebrew word
               <i>Ben</i>, signifies son, grandson,
               great-grandson, or <em>any one</em> of the posterity of an individual.
               Gen. xxix. 5, "<em>And he said unto them, Know ye Laban, the</em>
               SON <em>of Nahor</em>?" Yet Laban was the <em>grandson</em> of Nahor.
               Gen. xxiv. 15, 29. In 2 Sam. xix. 24, it is said, "<em>Mephibosheth,
                  the</em> SON <em>of Saul, came down to meet the king</em>." But
               Mephibosheth was the son of Jonathan, and the <em>grandson</em> of Saul.
               2 Sam. ix. 6. So Ruth iv. 17. "<em>There is a</em> SON <em>born to
                  Naomi</em>." This was the son of Ruth, the daughter-in-law of Naomi. Ruth
               iv. 13, 15. So 2 Sam. xxi. 6. "<em>Let seven men of his (Saul's)</em>
               SONS <em>be delivered unto us</em>," &amp;c. Seven of Saul's
               <em>grandsons</em> were delivered up. 2 Sam. xxi. 8, 9. So Gen. xxi. 28,
               "<em>And hast not suffered me to kiss my</em> SONS <em>and my
                  daughters</em>;" and in the 55th verse, "<em>And early in the morning
                  Laban rose up and kissed his</em> SONS," &amp;c. These were his
               <em>grandsons</em>. So 2 Kings ix. 20, "<em>The driving of Jehu,
                  the</em> SON <em>of Nimshi</em>." So 1 Kings xix. 16. But Jehu
               was the <em>grandson</em> of Nimshi. 2 Kings ix. 2, 14. Who will forbid
               the inspired writer to use the <em>same</em> word when speaking of
               <em>Noah's</em> grandson?

            <p>
               Further, if Ham were meant what propriety in calling him the
               <em>younger</em> son? The order in which Noah's sons are always mentioned,
               makes Ham the <em>second</em>, and not the <em>younger</em> son. If it
               be said that Bible usage is variable, and that the order of birth is not
               always preserved in enumerations; the reply is, that, enumeration in the order
               of birth, is the <em>rule</em>, in any other order the
               <em>exception</em>. Besides, if the younger member of a family, takes
               precedence of older ones in the family record, it is a mark of pre-eminence,
               either in original endowments, or providential instrumentality.
               Abraham, though sixty years younger than his eldest brother,
               and probably the youngest of Terah's sons, stands first in the family
               genealogy. Nothing in Ham's history warrants the idea of his pre-eminence;
               besides, the Hebrew word <i>Hakkaton</i>,
               rendered <em>younger</em>, means the <em>little, small</em>. The same
               word is used in Isaiah xl. 22. "A LITTLE ONE <em>shall become a
                  thousand</em>." Also in Isaiah xxii. 24. "<em>All vessels of</em> SMALL
               <em>quantity</em>." So Psalms cxv. 13. "<em>He will bless them that
                  fear the Lord, both</em> SMALL <em>and great</em>." Also Exodus xviii.
               22. "<em>But every</em> SMALL <em>matter they shall judge</em>." It
               would be a perfectly literal rendering of Gen. ix. 24, if it were translated
               thus, "when Noah knew what his little son<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN21"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN21"></a>, or grandson
               (<i>Beno hakkaton</i>)
               had done unto him, he said, cursed be Canaan," &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN21"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN21">A</a>: The French
               language in this respect follows the same analogy. Our word
               <em>grandson</em> being in French, <i>petit
                  fils</i>, (little son.)
            </p>
            <p>
               Even if the Africans were the descendants of Canaan, the assumption that their
               enslavement is a fulfilment of this prophecy, lacks even plausibility, for,
               only a mere <em>fraction</em> of the inhabitants of Africa have at any one
               time been the slaves of other nations. If the objector say in reply, that
               a large majority of the Africans have always been slaves at <em>home</em>,
               we answer, 1st. <em>It is false in point of fact</em>, though zealously
               bruited often to serve a turn. 2d. <em>If it were true</em>, how does it
               help the argument? The prophecy was, "Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants
               shall he be unto his brethren" not unto <em>himself</em>!

               Arguments drawn from the Mosaic system in support of slavery, originate
               in a misconception both of its genius, <em>as a whole</em>, and of the
               design and scope of its most simple provisions. The verses quoted above,
               afford an illustration in point.

            </p>
            <p>
               What was the design of this regulation? Was it to grant masters an
               indulgence to beat servants with impunity? and an assurance, that if they
               beat them to death, the offence would not be <em>capital</em>? This is
               substantially what some modern Doctors tell us. What Deity do such men
               worship? Some blood-gorged Moloch, enthroned on human hecatombs,
               and snuffing carnage for incense? Did He who thundered out from Sinai's
               flames, "THOU SHALT NOT KILL," offer a bounty on <em>murder</em>? Whoever
               analyzes the Mosaic system&#8212;the condition of the people for whom
               it was made&#8212;their inexperience in government&#8212;ignorance of judicial
               proceedings&#8212;laws of evidence, &amp;c., will find a moot court in
               session, trying law points&#8212;setting definitions, or laying down rules of
               evidence, in almost every chapter. Numbers xxxv. 10-22; Deuteronomy xi. 11,
               and xix. 4-6; Leviticus xxiv. 19-22; Exodus, xxi. 18, 19, are a few,
               out of many cases stated, with tests furnished by which to detect
               <em>the intent</em>, in actions brought before them. The detail gone into,
               in the verses quoted, is manifestly to enable the judges to get at the
               <em>motive</em> of the action, and find out whether the master
               <em>designed</em> to kill.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. "If a man smite his servant with a <em>rod</em>."&#8212;The instrument
               used, gives a clue to the <em>intent</em>. See Numbers xxxv. 16, 18. It
               was a <em>rod</em>, not an axe, nor a sword, nor a bludgeon, nor any
               other death-weapon&#8212;hence, from the <i>kind</i> of
               instrument, no design to <em>kill</em> would be inferred; for
               <em>intent</em> to kill would hardly have taken a <em>rod</em> for its
               weapon. But if the servant dies <em>under his hand</em>, then the
               unfitness of the instrument, instead of being evidence in his favor, is point
               blank against him; for, to strike him with a <em>rod</em> until he
               <em>dies</em>, argues a <em>great many</em> blows laid on with
               <em>great</em> violence, and this kept up to the death-gasp, establishes
               the point of <em>intent to kill</em>. Hence the sentence, "He shall
               <em>surely</em> be punished." The case is plain and strong. But if he
               continued <em>a day or two</em>, the <em>length of time that he
                  lived</em>, together with the <em>kind</em> of instrument
               used, and the fact that the master had a pecuniary interest in his
               <em>life</em>, ("he is his <em>money</em>,") all, made out a strong
               case of circumstantial evidence, showing that the master did not
               <em>design</em> to kill; and required

               a corresponding decision and sentence. A single remark on the
               word "punished:" in Exodus xxi. 20, 21, the Hebrew word here rendered
               <i>punished</i>,
               (<i>Nakum</i>,) is <em>not so rendered
                  in another instance</em>. Yet it occurs thirty-five times in the Old
               Testament&#8212;in almost every instance, it is translated
               <em>avenge</em>&#8212;in a few, "<em>to take vengeance</em>," or
               "<em>to revenge</em>," and in this instance ALONE, "<em>punish</em>."
               As it stands in our translation, the pronoun preceding it, refers to the
               <em>master</em>&#8212;the <em>master</em> in the 21st verse, is to be
               <em>punished</em>, and in the 22d <em>not</em> to be punished;
               whereas the preceding pronoun refers neither to the <em>master</em> nor
               to the <em>servant</em>, but to the <em>crime</em>, and the word
               rendered <em>punished</em>, should have been rendered
               <em>avenged</em>. The meaning is this: If a man smite his servant
               or his maid with a rod, and he die under his hand, IT (the death)
               shall surely be avenged, or literally, <em>by avenging it shall be
                  avenged</em>; that is, the <em>death</em> of the servant shall be
               <em>avenged</em> by the <em>death</em> of the master. So in the next
               verse&#8212;"If he continues a day or two," his death shall not be avenged by
               the <em>death</em> of the <em>master</em>, for in that case
               the crime was to be adjudged <em>manslaughter</em>, and not
               <em>murder</em>, as in the first instance. In the following verse, another
               case of personal injury is stated, not intentional, nor extending to life or
               limb, a mere accidental hurt, for which the injurer is to pay <em>a sum of
                  money</em>; and yet our translators employ the same phraseology in both
               places. One, an instance of deliberate, wanton, <em>killing by
                  piecemeal</em>. The other and <em>accidental</em>, and comparatively
               slight injury&#8212;of the inflicter, in both cases, they say the same
               thing! "<em>He shall surely be punished</em>." Now, just the difference
               which common sense would expect to find in such cases, where GOD legislates,
               is strongly marked in the original. In the case of the servant wilfully
               murdered, God says, "It (the death) shall surely be <em>avenged</em>,"
               (<i>Nakum</i>,) that is, <em>the life
                  of the wrong doer shall expiate the crime</em>. The same word is used in the
               Old Testament, when the greatest wrongs are redressed, by devoting the
               perpetrators, whether individuals or communities, to <em>destruction</em>.
               In the case of the <em>unintentional</em> injury, in the following verse,
               God says, "He shall surely be" <em>fined</em>,
               (<i>Aunash</i>.) "He shall
               <em>pay</em> as the judges determine." The simple meaning of the word
               <i>Aunash</i>, is to lay a fine. It is
               used in Deut. xxii. 19. They shall
               <i>amerce</i> him in one hundred
               shekels," and in 2 Chron. xxxvi. 3&#8212;"He condemned
               (<i>mulcted</i>) the land in a hundred talents of
               gold.&#8212;This is the general use of the word, and its primary
               signification. That <em>avenging</em> the death of the servant, was
               neither imprisonment, nor stripes, nor amercing the master in damages, but
               that it was <em>taking the master's life</em> we infer.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. From the <em>Bible usage</em> of the word Nakam. See Genesis iv.
               24; Joshua x. 13; Judges xv. 7-xvi. 28; 1 Samuel xiv. 24-xviii. 25-xxv.
               31; 2 Samuel iv. 8; Judges v. 2; 1 Samuel xxv. 26-33, &amp;c. &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. From the express statute in such case provided. Leviticus xxiv.
               17. "<em>He that killeth</em> ANY <em>man</em> shall surely be
               put to death." Also Numbers xxxv. 30, 31. "<em>Whoso killeth</em>
               ANY <em>person</em>, the murderer
               shall be put to death. <em>Moreover ye shall take</em> NO
               SATISFACTION <em>for the life of a murderer which is guilty of death,
                  but he shall surely be put to death</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               3. The Targum of Jonathan gives the verse thus, "Death by the
               sword shall assuredly be adjudged." The Targum of Jerusalem thus,
               "Vengeance shall be taken for him to the <em>uttermost</em>." Jarchi gives
               the same rendering. The Samaritan version thus, "He shall die the
               death."

            </p>
            <p>
               Again, the last clause in the 21st verse ("for he is his money") is
               often quoted to prove that the servant is his master's <em>property</em>, and <em>therefore</em>,
               if he died, the master was not <em>to be punished</em>. <em>Because</em>, 1st. A
               man may dispose of his <em>property</em> as he pleases. 2d. If the servant
               died of the injury, the master's <em>loss</em> was a sufficient punishment. A
               word about the premises, before we notice the inferences. The assumption
               is, that the phrase, "HE IS HIS MONEY," proves not only that
               the servant is <em>worth money</em> to the master, but that he is an <em>article of property</em>.
               If the advocates of slavery will take this principle of interpretation
               into the Bible, and turn it loose, let them either give bonds for its
               behavior, or else stand and draw in self-defence, "lest it turn again and
               rend" them. If they endorse for it at one point, they must stand sponsors
               all around the circle. It will be too late to cry for quarter when
               they find its stroke clearing the whole table, and tilting them among
               the sweepings beneath. The Bible abounds with such expressions as
               the following: "This (bread) <em>is</em> my body;" "this (wine) <em>is</em> my blood;"
               "all they (the Israelites) <em>are</em> brass, and tin, and iron, and lead;" "this
               <em>is</em> life eternal, that they might know thee;" "this (the water of the well
               of Bethlehem) <em>is</em> the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their
               lives;" "I <em>am</em> the lily of the valleys;" "a garden enclosed <em>is</em> my sister;"
               "my tears <em>have been</em> my meat;" "the Lord God <em>is</em> a sun and a
               shield;" "God <em>is</em> love;" "the Lord <em>is</em> my rock;" "the seven good
               ears <em>are</em> seven years, and the seven good kine <em>are</em> seven years;" "the
               seven thin and ill-favored kine <em>are</em> seven years, and the seven empty
               ears blasted by the east wind <em>shall be</em> seven years of famine;" "he
               <em>shall be</em> head, and thou <em>shall</em> be tail;" "the Lord <em>will</em> be a wall of fire;"
               "they <em>shall</em> be one flesh;" "the tree of the field <em>is</em> man's life;" "God
               <em>is</em> a consuming fire;" "he <em>is</em> his money," &amp;c. A passion for the exact
               <em>literalities</em> of Bible language is so amiable, it were hard not to gratify
               it in this case. The words in the original are (Kaspo-hu,) "his <em>silver</em>
               is he." The objector's principle of interpretation is, a philosopher's
               stone! Its miracle touch transmutes five feet eight inches of flesh and
               bones into <em>solid silver</em>! Quite a <em>permanent</em> servant, if not so nimble
               with all&#8212;reasoning against "<em>forever</em>," is forestalled henceforth, and,
               Deut. xxiii. 15, utterly outwitted.

            </p>
            <p>
               Who in his senses believes that in the expression, "<em>He is his money</em>,"
               the object was to inculcate the doctrine that the servant was a <i>chattel</i>?
               The obvious meaning is, he is <em>worth money</em> to his master, and since, if
               the master killed him, it would take money out of his pocket, the <em>pecuniary
                  loss</em>, the <em>kind of instrument used</em>, and <em>the fact of his living some
                  time after the injury</em>, (as, if the master <em>meant</em> to kill, he would be likely
               to <em>do</em> it while about it,) all together make out a strong case of presumptive
               evidence clearing the master of <em>intent to kill</em>. But let us look at the
               objector's inferences. One is, that as the master might dispose of his
               <em>property</em> as he pleased, he was not to be punished, if he destroyed it.
               Answer. Whether the servant died under the master's hand, or continued
               a day or two, he was <em>equally</em> his master's property, and the objector
               admits that in the <em>first</em> case the master is to be "surely punished" for
               destroying <em>his own property</em>! The other inference is, that since the
               continuance of a day or two, cleared the master of <em>intent to kill</em>, the loss
               of the slave would be a sufficient punishment for inflicting the injury
               which caused his death. This inference makes the Mosaic law false to
               its own principles. A <em>pecuniary loss</em>, constituted no part of the claims
               of the law, where a person took the <em>life</em> of another. In such case, the law
               utterly spurned money, however large the sum. God would not so cheapen
               human life, as to balance it with such a weight. "<em>Ye shall take no satisfaction
                  for the life of a murderer, but he shall surely be put to death</em>." See
               Numb. xxxv. 31. Even in excusable homicide, a case of death purely accidental,
               as where an axe slipped from the helve and killed a man, no sum
               of money availed to release from confinement in the city of refuge, until
               the death of the High Priest. Numbers xxxv. 32. The doctrine that the
               loss of the servant would be a penalty <em>adequate</em> to the desert of the master,
               admits the master's <em>guilt</em>&#8212;his desert of <em>some</em> punishment, and it prescribes
               a <em>kind</em> of punishment, rejected by the law, in all cases where
               man took the life of man, whether with or without <em>intent</em> to kill. In

               short, the objector annuls an integral part of the system&#8212;resolves himself
               into a legislature, with power in the premises, makes a <em>new</em> law,
               and coolly metes out such penalty as he thinks fit, both in kind and
               quantity. Mosaic statutes amended, and Divine legislation revised and
               improved!

            <p>
               The master who struck out the tooth of a servant, whether intentionally
               or not, was required to set him free for his tooth's sake. The
               <em>pecuniary loss</em> to the master was the same as though the servant had
               <em>died</em>. Look at the two cases. A master beats his servant so severely,
               that after a day or two he dies of his wounds; another master accidentally
               strikes out his servant's tooth, and his servant is free&#8212;<em>the pecuniary
                  loss of both masters is the same.</em> The objector contends that
               the loss of the slave's services in the first case is punishment sufficient
               for the crime of killing him; yet God commands the <em>same</em> punishment
               for even the <em>accidental</em> knocking out of a <em>tooth</em>! Indeed, unless the injury
               was done <em>inadvertently</em>, the loss of the servant's services is only a
               <em>part</em> of the punishment&#8212;mere reparation to the <em>individual</em> for injury
               done; the <em>main</em> punishment, that strictly <em>judicial</em>, was, reparation to the
               <em>community</em> for injury to one of its members. To set the servant <em>free</em>,
               and thus proclaim his injury, his right to redress, and the measure of it&#8212;answered
               not the ends of public justice. The law made an example of
               the offender, "those that remain might hear and fear." <em>"If a man
                  cause a blemish in his neighbour, as he hath done, so shall it be done unto
                  him. Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath caused
                  a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again. You have one
                  manner of law as well for the</em> STRANGER <em>as for one of your own country</em>."
               Lev. xxiv. 19, 20, 22. Finally, if a master smote out the tooth
               of a servant, the law smote out <em>his</em> tooth&#8212;thus redressing the <em>public</em>
               wrong; and it cancelled the servant's obligation to the master, thus
               giving some compensation for the injury done, and exempting him from
               perilous liabilities in future.

               See <a href="#E4_prop" class="ref">p. 36</a>.) We will now ascertain what sanction to slavery is
               derivable from the terms "bondmen," "inheritance," and "forever."

            </p>
            <p>
               I. BONDMEN. The fact that servants, from the heathen are called
               "<i>bondmen</i>," while others are called "servants," is quoted as proof that
               the former were slaves. As the <em>caprices</em> of King James' translators
               were not divinely inspired, we need stand in no special awe of them.
               The word rendered <i>bondmen</i>, in this passage, is the same word uniformly
               rendered <i>servants</i> elsewhere. To infer from this that the Gentile
               servants were slaves, is absurd. Look at the use of the Hebrew word
               "<i>Ebed</i>," the plural of which is here translated "<i>bondmen</i>." In Isaiah
               xlii. 1, the <em>same word</em> is applied to Christ. "Behold my <em>servant</em> (bondman,
               slave?) whom I have chosen, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth."
               So Isaiah lii. 13. "Behold my <em>servant</em> (Christ) shall deal
               prudently." In 1 Kings xii. 6, 7, it is applied to <i>King Rehoboam</i>. "And
               they (the old men) spake unto him, saying if thou wilt be a <em>servant</em>
               (Ebed) unto this people this day, and will serve them and answer them,
               and wilt speak good words to them, then they will be thy <em>servants</em> forever."
               In 2 Chron. xii. 7, 8, 9, 13, it is applied to the king and all the
               nation. In fine, the word is applied to <em>all</em> persons doing service to
               others&#8212;to magistrates, to all governmental officers, to tributaries, to all
               the subjects of governments, to younger sons&#8212;defining their relation to
               the first born, who is called <i>Lord</i> and <i>ruler</i>&#8212;to prophets, to kings, to
               the Messiah, and in respectful addresses not less than <em>fifty</em> times in the
               Old Testament.

            </p>
            <p>
               If the Israelites not only held slaves, but multitudes of them, why had
               their language <em>no word</em> that <em>meant slave</em>? If Abraham had thousands,
               and if they <em>abounded</em> under the Mosaic system, why had they no such
               <em>word</em> as slave or slavery? That language must be wofully poverty
               stricken, which has <em>no signs</em> to represent the most <em>common</em> and <em>familiar</em>
               objects and conditions. To represent by the same word, and without
               figure, <em>property</em>, and the <em>owner</em> of that property, is a solecism. Ziba
               was an "Ebed," yet he <em>"owned</em>" (!) twenty <i>Ebeds</i>. In <em>English</em>, we
               have both the words <em>servant</em> and <em>slave</em>. Why? Because we have both
               the <em>things</em>, and need <em>signs</em> for them. If the tongue had a sheath, as
               swords have scabbards, we should have some <em>name</em> for it: but our dictionaries

               give us none. Why? because there is no such <em>thing</em>. But
               the objector asks, "Would not the Israelites use their word <i>Ebed</i> if they
               spoke of the slave of a heathen?" Answer. The servants of individuals
               among the heathen are scarcely ever alluded to. <i>National</i> servants
               or <i>tributaries</i>, are spoken of frequently, but so rarely are their
               <i>domestic</i> servants alluded to, no necessity existed, even if they were
               slaves, for coining a new word. Besides, the fact of their being domestics,
               under <em>heathen laws and usages</em>, proclaimed their <i>liabilities</i>; their
               locality told their condition; so that in applying to them the word <i>Ebed</i>,
               there would be no danger of being misunderstood. But if the Israelites
               had not only <em>servants</em>, but besides these, a multitude of <em>slaves</em>, a <em>word
                  meaning slave</em>, would have been indispensable for purposes of every
               day convenience. Further, the laws of the Mosaic system were so many
               sentinels on every side, to warn off foreign practices. The border
               ground of Canaan, was quarantine ground, enforcing the strictest non-intercourse
               between the <em>without</em> and the <em>within</em>, not of <em>persons</em>, but of
               <em>usages</em>. The fact that the Hebrew language had no words corresponding
               to <i>slave</i> and <i>slavery</i>, though not a conclusive argument, is no slight
               corroborative.

               II. "FOREVER."&#8212;"They shall be your bondmen <em>forever</em>." This
               is quoted to prove that servants were to serve during their life time, and
               their posterity, from generation to generation.

            </p>
            <p>
               No such idea is contained in the passage. The word <em>forever</em>, instead
               of defining the length of <i>individual</i> service, proclaims the <i>permanence</i>
               of the regulation laid down in the two verses preceding, namely, that
               their <i>permanent domestics</i> should be of the <i>Strangers</i>, and not of the Israelites;
               and it declares the duration of that general provision. As if
               God had said, "You shall <em>always</em> get your <em>permanent</em> laborers from
               the nations round about you&#8212;your <i>servants</i> shall always be of <i>that</i> class
               of persons." As it stands in the original, it is plain&#8212;"<em>Forever of them
                  shall ye serve yourselves</em>." This is the literal rendering of the Hebrew
               words, which, in our version, are translated, "<em>They shall be your bondmen
                  forever</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               This construction is in keeping with the whole of the passage. "Both
               thy bondmen and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the
               <em>heathen</em> (the nations) that are round about you. OF THEM shall ye buy
               bondmen and bondmaids. Moreover of the children of the strangers
               that do sojourn among you, OF THEM shall ye buy," &amp;c. The design
               of this passage is manifest from its structure. It was to point out the
               <i>class</i> of persons from which they were to get their supply of servants,

               and the <i>way</i> in which they were to get them. That "<em>forever</em>" refers
               to the permanent relations of a <i>community</i>, rather than to the services of
               <i>individuals</i>, is a fair inference from the form of the expression, "THEY
               shall be your possession. Ye shall take <em>them</em> as an inheritance for your
               children to inherit them for a possession." To say nothing of the uncertainty
               of <em>these individuals</em> surviving those <em>after</em> whom they are to
               live, the language used, applies more naturally to a <i>body</i> of people, than
               to <i>individual</i> servants.

            </p>
            <p>
               But suppose it otherwise; still <i>perpetual</i> service could not be argued
               from the term <i>forever</i>. The ninth and tenth verses of the same chapter,
               limit it absolutely by the jubilee. "<em>Then shall thou cause the trumpet
                  of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month: in the
                  day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout</em> ALL <em>your
                  land." "And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
                  throughout all the land unto</em> ALL <em>the inhabitants thereof</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               It may be objected that "inhabitants" here means <i>Israelitish</i> inhabitants
               alone. The command is, "Proclaim liberty throughout all the
               land unto ALL <em>the inhabitants thereof</em>." Besides, in the sixth verse,
               there is an enumeration of the different classes of the inhabitants, in
               which servants and strangers are included. "<em>And the Sabbath of the
                  land shall be meet for</em> YOU&#8212;[For whom? For you <i>Israelites</i> only?]&#8212;<em>for
                  thee, and for thy</em> SERVANT, <em>and for thy maid, and for thy hired
                  servant, and for thy</em> STRANGER <em>that sojourneth with thee</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               Further, in all the regulations of the jubilee, and the sabbatical year,
               the strangers are included in the precepts, prohibitions, and promised
               blessings. Again: the year of jubilee was ushered in, by the day of
               atonement. What was the design of these institutions? The day of
               atonement prefigured the atonement of Christ, and the year of jubilee,
               the gospel jubilee. And did they prefigure an atonement and a jubilee
               to <em>Jews</em> only? Were they the types of sins remitted, and of salvation,
               proclaimed to the nation of <em>Israel</em> alone? Is there no redemption for
               us Gentiles in these ends of the earth, and is our hope presumption and
               impiety? Did that old partition wall survive the shock, that made earth
               quake, and hid the sun, burst graves and rocks, and rent the temple
               vail? And did the Gospel only rear it higher to thunder direr perdition
               from its frowning battlements on all without? No! The God of OUR
               salvation lives. "Good tidings of great joy shall be to ALL people."
               <em>One</em> shout shall swell from <em>all</em> the ransomed, "Thou hast redeemed us
               unto God by thy blood out of EVERY kindred, and tongue, and people,
               and nation." To deny that the blessings of the jubilee extended to the

               servants from the <em>Gentiles</em>, makes Christianity <em>Judaism</em>.
               It not only
               eclipses the glory of the Gospel, but strikes out the sun. The refusal to
               release servants at the sound of the jubilee trumpet, falsified and disannulled
               a grand leading type of the atonement, and thus libelled the doctrine
               of Christ's redemption.

            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, even if <em>forever</em> did refer to the length of <i>individual</i> service,
               we have ample precedents for limiting the term by the jubilee. The
               same word is used to define the length of time for which those <em>Jewish</em>
               servants were held, who refused to go out in the <em>seventh</em> year. And all
               admit that their term of service did not go beyond the jubilee. Ex. xxi.
               2-6; Deut. xv. 12-17.

            </p>
            <p>
               The 23d verse of the same chapter is quoted to prove that "<em>forever</em>"
               in the 46th verse, extends beyond the jubilee. "<em>The land shall not be
                  sold</em> FOREVER, <em>for the land is mine</em>"&#8212;as it would hardly be used in different
               senses in the same general connection. In reply, we repeat that
               <i>forever</i> respects the duration of the <i>general arrangement</i>, and not that
               of <i>individual service</i>. Consequently, it is not affected by the jubilee; so
               the objection does not touch the argument. But it may not be amiss
               to show that it is equally harmless against any other argument drawn
               from the use of forever in the 46th verse,&#8212;for the word there used, is
               <i>Olam</i>, meaning <i>throughout the period</i>, whatever that may be. Whereas
               in the 23d verse, it is <i>Tsemithuth</i>, meaning <i>cutting off</i>, or <i>to be cut
                  off</i>.

               INHERITANCE <em>for your children after you to inherit them for a possession</em>."
               This refers to the <em>nations</em>, and not to the <em>individual</em> servants, procured
               from these nations. We have already shown, that servants could not
               be held as a <em>property</em>-possession, and inheritance; that they became
               servants of their <em>own accord</em>, and were paid wages; that they were released
               by law from their regular labor nearly <em>half the days in each
                  year</em>, and thoroughly <em>instructed</em>; that the servants were <em>protected</em> in all
               their personal, social, and religious rights, equally with their masters,
               &amp;c. Now, truly, all remaining, after these ample reservations, would
               be small temptation, either to the lust of power or of lucre. What a
               profitable "possession" and "inheritance!" What if our American
               slaves were all placed in <em>just such a condition</em>! Alas, for that soft, melodious
               circumlocution, "Our PECULIAR species of property!" Truly,

               meaning by other passages&#8212;and all to eke out such a sense as accords
               with existing usages and sanctifies them, thus making God pander for
               their lusts. Little matter whether the meaning of the word be primary
               or secondary, literal or figurative, <em>provided</em> it sustains their practices.

               But let us inquire whether the words rendered "inherit" and "inheritance,"
               when used in the Old Testament, necessarily point out the
               things inherited and possessed as <em>articles of property</em>. <i>Nahal</i> and <i>Nahala</i>&#8212;<i>inherit</i>
               and <i>inheritance</i>. See 2 Chronicles x. 16. "The people
               answered the king and said, What portion have we in David, and we
               have none <em>inheritance</em> in the son of Jesse." Did they mean gravely to
               disclaim the holding of their king as an article of <em>property?</em> Psalms
               cxxvii. 3&#8212;"Lo, children are an <i>heritage</i> (inheritance) of the Lord."
               Exodus xxxiv. 9&#8212;"Pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for
               thine <i>inheritance</i>." When God pardons his enemies, and adopts them
               as his children, does he make them <em>articles of property?</em> Are forgiveness,
               and chattel-making, synonymes? Psalms cxix. 111&#8212;"Thy testimonies
               have I taken as a <i>heritage</i> (inheritance) forever." Ezekiel
               xliv. 27, 28&#8212;"And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto
               the inner court to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin-offering,
               saith the Lord God. And it shall be unto them for an <i>inheritance</i>; <em>I</em>
               am their <i>inheritance</i>." Psalms ii. 8&#8212;"Ask of me, and I will give thee the
               heathen for thine <i>inheritance</i>." Psalms xciv. 14&#8212;"For the Lord will
               not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his <i>inheritance</i>." See
               also Deuteronomy iv. 20; Joshua xiii. 33; Chronicles x. 16; Psalms

               The question whether the servants were a PROPERTY&#8212;"<i>possession</i>,"
               has been already discussed&#8212;(See <a href="#E4_prop" class="ref">p. 36</a>)&#8212;we need add in this place
               but a word. <i>Ahusa</i> rendered "<i>possession</i>." Genesis xlii. 11&#8212;"And
               Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a <i>possession</i>
               in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as

               In what sense was the land of Goshen the <i>possession</i> of the Israelites?
               Answer, In the sense of, <i>having it to live in</i>. In what sense were the
               Israelites to <em>possess</em> these nations, and <em>take them</em> as an <em>inheritance for
                  their children?</em> We answer, They possessed them as <em>a permanent
                  source of supply for domestic or household servants. And this relation
                  to these nations was to go down to posterity as a standing regulation&#8212;a
                  national usage respecting them, having the certainty and regularity of a
                  descent by inheritance</em>. The sense of the whole regulation may be
               given thus: "Thy permanent domestics, both male and female, which

               thou shalt have, shall be of the nations that are round about you, of <em>them</em>
               shall ye get male and female domestics." "Moreover of the children of
               the foreigners that do sojourn among you, of <em>them</em> shall ye get, and of
               their families that are with you, which they begat in your land, and <em>they</em>
               shall be your permanent resource," (for household servants.) "And ye
               shall take them as a <em>perpetual</em> provision for your children after you, to
               hold as a <em>constant source of supply</em>. ALWAYS <em>of them</em> shall ye serve
               yourselves."

               From the fact that only <em>one</em> class of the servants is called <i>hired</i>, it is
               sagely inferred that servants of the <em>other</em> class were <em>not paid</em> for their
               labor. That is, that while God thundered anathemas against those who
               "used their neighbor's service <em>without wages</em>," he granted a special
               indulgence to his chosen people to seize persons, force them to work,
               and rob them of earnings, provided always, in selecting their victims,
               they spared "the gentlemen of property and standing," and pounced
               only upon the <em>strangers</em> and the <em>common</em> people. The inference that
               "<i>hired</i>" is synonimous with <i>paid</i>, and that those servants not <em>called</em>
               "hired" were <em>not paid</em> for their labor, is a <em>mere assumption</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               The meaning of the English verb <i>to hire</i>, is, as every one knows, to
               procure for a temporary use at a curtain price&#8212;to engage a person to
               <em>temporary</em> service for wages. That is also the meaning of the Hebrew
               word "<i>Saukar</i>." <em>Temporary</em> service, and generally for a <em>specific</em> object,
               is inseparable from its meaning. It is never used when the procurement
               of <em>permanent</em> service, for a long period, is spoken of. Now,
               we ask, would <em>permanent</em> servants, those who constituted an integral
               and stationary part of the family, have been designated by the same
               term that marks <em>temporary</em> servants? The every-day distinctions made
               on this subject, are as familiar as table-talk. In many families, the domestics
               perform only such labor, as every day brings along with it&#8212;the
               <em>regular</em> work. Whatever is <em>occasional</em> merely, as the washing of a
               family, is done by persons <em>hired expressly for the purpose</em>. In such
               families, the familiar distinction between the two classes, is "servants,"
               or "domestics," and "hired help," (not <em>paid</em> help.) <em>Both</em> classes are
               <em>paid</em>. One is permanent, the other occasional and temporary, and
               therefore in this case called "<em>hired</em>." To suppose a servant robbed
               of his earnings, because when spoken of, he is not called a <em>hired</em> servant,

               is profound induction! If I employ a man at twelve dollars a
               month to work my farm, he is my <em>"hired"</em> man, but if, instead of giving
               him so much a month, I <em>give him such a portion of the crop</em>, or in other
               words, if he works my farm <i>"on shares,"</i> he is no longer my <em>hired</em>
               man. Every farmer knows that <em>that</em> designation is not applied to him.
               Yet he works the same farm, in the same way, at the same times, and
               with the same teams and tools; and does the same amount of work in
               the year, and perhaps clears twenty dollars a month, instead of the
               twelve, paid him while he was my <em>hired</em> laborer. Now, as the technic
               <i>"hired"</i> is no longer used to designate him, and as he still labors on my
               farm, suppose my neighbors gather in conclave, and from such ample
               premises sagely infer, that since he is no longer my <em>"hired"</em> laborer, I
               <em>rob</em> him of his earnings, and with all the gravity of owls, they record
               their decision, and adjourn to hoot it abroad. My neighbors are deep
               divers!&#8212;like some theological professors, they not only go to the bottom,
               but come up covered with the tokens.

               A variety of particulars are recorded in the Bible, distinguishing <i>hired</i>
               from <em>bought</em> servants. (1.) Hired servants were paid daily at the close
               of their work. Lev. xix 13; Deut. xxiv. 14, 15; Job. vii. 2; Matt. xx.
               8. <i>"Bought"</i> servants were paid in advance, (a reason for their being
               called, <i>bought</i>,) and those that went out at the seventh year received a
               <i>gratuity</i> at the close of their period of service. Deut. xv. 12-13. (2.)
               The hired servant was paid <em>in money</em>, the bought servant received his
               <i>gratuity</i>, at least, in grain, cattle, and the product of the vintage. Deut.
               xiv. 17. (3.) The <i>hired</i> servant <em>lived by himself</em>, in his own family.
               The <i>bought</i> servant was a part of his master's family. (4.) The <i>hired</i>
               servant supported his family out of his wages; the <i>bought</i> servant and
               his family, were supported by the master <em>besides</em> his wages.

               A careful investigation of the condition of "<i>hired</i>" and of "<i>bought</i>"
               servants, shows that the latter were, <em>as a class, superior to the former</em>&#8212;were
               more trust-worthy, had greater privileges, and occupied in every
               respect (<em>other</em> things being equal) a higher station in society. (1.)
               <em>They were intimately incorporated with the family of the master</em>. They
               were guests at family festivals, and social solemnities, from which hired
               servants were excluded. Lev. xxii. 10; Exod. xii. 43, 45. (2) <em>Their
                  interests were far more identified with the general interests of their masters'
                  family.</em> Bought servants were often actually, or prospectively,
               heirs of their master's estate. Witness the case of Eliezer, of Ziba, of
               the sons of Bilhah, and Zilpah, and others. When there were no sons
               to inherit the estate, or when, by unworthiness, they had forfeited their

               title, bought servants were made heirs. Proverbs xvii. 2. We find
               traces of this usage in the New Testament. "But when the husbandmen
               saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, this is the <em>heir</em>,
               come let us kill him, <em>that the inheritance may be ours</em>." Luke xx. 14;
               also Mark xii. 7. In no instance on Bible record, does a <i>hired</i> servant
               inherit his master's estate. (3.) <em>Marriages took place between servants
                  and their master's daughters</em>. "Now Sheshan had no sons, but daughters:
               and Sheshan had a <em>servant</em>, an Egyptian, whose name was Jarha.
               And Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant to wife." 1 Chron.
               ii. 34, 35. There is no instance of a <em>hired</em> servant forming such
               an alliance.

            </p>
            <p>
               (4.) <em>Bought servants and their descendants seem to have been regarded
                  with the same affection and respect as the other members of the
                  family [A]</em>
               The treatment of Eliezer, and the other servants in the family of
               Abraham, Gen. chap. 25&#8212;the intercourse between Gideon and his servant
               Phurah, Judges vii. 10, 11. and Saul and his servant, in their interview
               with Samuel, 1 Sam. ix. 5, 22; and Jonathan and his servant,
               1 Sam. xiv. 1-14, and Elisha and his servant Gehazi, are illustrations.
               No such tie seems to have existed between <i>hired</i> servants and their masters.
               Their untrustworthiness seems to have been proverbial. See
               John ix. 12, 13.

            </p>
            <p>
               None but the <em>lowest class</em> seem to have engaged as hired servants.
               No instance occurs in which they are assigned to business demanding
               much knowledge or skill. Various passages show the low repute and
               trifling character of the class from which they were hired. Judges ix.
               4; 1 Sam. ii. 5.

            </p>
            <p>
               The superior condition and privileges of bought servants, are manifested
               in the high trusts confided to them, and in the dignity and authority
               with which they were clothed in their master's household. But in no
               instance is a <em>hired</em> servant thus distinguished. In some cases, the
               <em>bought</em> servant is manifestly the master's representative in the family&#8212;with
               plenipotentiary powers over adult children, even negotiating marriage
               for them. Abraham besought Eliezer his servant, to take a
               solemn oath, that HE would not take a wife for Isaac of the daughters
               of the Canaanites, but from Abraham's kindred. The servant

               went accordingly, and <em>himself</em> selected the individual. Servants
               also exercised discretionary power in the management of their master's
               estate, "And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master,
               <em>for all the goods of his master were under his hand</em>." Gen. xxiv. 10. The reason assigned for taking them, is not that such was Abraham's direction,
               but that the servant had discretionary control. Servants had also
               discretionary power in the <em>disposal of property</em>. See Gen. xxiv. 22,
               23, 53. The condition of Ziba in the house of Mephiboseth, is a case
               in point. So is Prov. xvii. 2. Distinct traces of this estimation are to
               be found in the New Testament, Math. xxiv. 45; Luke xii. 42, 44.
               So in the parable of the talents; the master seems to have set up each
               of his servants in trade with considerable capital. One of them could
               not have had less than eight thousand dollars. The parable of the unjust
               steward is another illustration. Luke xvi. 4, 8. He evidently was
               entrusted with large <em>discretionary</em> power, was "accused of wasting his master's goods." and manifestly regulated with his master's debtors, the
               <em>terms</em> of settlement. Such trusts were never reposed in <em>hired</em>
               servants.

            </p>
            <p>
               The inferior condition of <em>hired</em> servants, is illustrated in the parable
               of the prodigal son. When the prodigal, perishing with hunger among
               the swine and husks, came to himself, his proud heart broke; "I will
               arise," he cried, "and go to my father." And then to assure his father
               of the depth of his humility, resolved to add imploringly, "Make me as
               one of thy <em>hired</em> servants." It need not be remarked, that if <em>hired</em> servants were the <em>superior</em> class; to apply for the situation, and press the
               suit, savored little of that sense of unworthiness that seeks the dust with
               hidden face, and cries "unclean." Unhumbled nature <em>climbs</em>; or if it
               falls, clings fast, where first it may. Humility sinks of its own weight,
               and in the lowest deep, digs lower. The design of the parable was to
               illustrate on the one hand, the joy of God, as he beholds afar off, the
               returning sinner "seeking an injured father's face" who runs to clasp
               and bless him with an unchiding welcome; and on the other, the contrition
               of the penitent, turning homeward with tears, from his wanderings,
               his stricken spirit breaking with its ill-desert, he sobs aloud,
               "The lowest place, <em>the lowest place</em>, I can abide no other." Or in those
               inimitable words, "<em>Father, I have sinned against Heaven, and in thy
                  sight, and no more worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of
                  thy</em> HIRED <em>servants</em>." The supposition that <em>hired</em> servants were the <em>highest</em> class, takes from the parable an element of winning beauty and pathos. It is manifest to every careful student of the Bible,
               that <em>one</em>
               class of servants, was on terms of equality with the children and other

               members of the family. (Hence the force of Paul's declaration, Gal.
               iv. 1, <em>"Now I say unto you, that the heir, so long as he is a child,</em> DIFFERETH
               NOTHING FROM A SERVANT, <em>though he be lord of all."</em>) If this
               were the <em>hired</em> class, the prodigal was a sorry specimen of humility.
               Would our Lord have put such language, into the lips of one held up
               by himself, as a model of gospel humility, to illustrate its lowliness, its
               conscious destitution of all merit, and deep sense of all ill desert? If
               this is <em>humility</em>, put it on stilts, and set it a strutting, while pride takes
               lessons, and blunders in apeing it.

            </p>
            <p>
               Here let it be observed, that both Israelites and Strangers, belonged
               indiscriminately to <em>each</em> class of the servants, the <i>bought</i> and the <i>hired</i>. That those in the former class, whether Jews or Strangers, were in
               higher estimation, and rose to honors and authority in the family circle,
               which were not conferred on <em>hired</em> servants, has been already shown. It
               should be added, however, that in the enjoyment of privileges, merely
               <i>political</i> and <i>national</i>, the hired servants from the <em>Israelites</em>, were more favored than either the hired, or the bought servants from the <i>Strangers</i>. No one from the Strangers, however wealthy or highly endowed, was eligible to the highest office, nor could he own the soil.
               This last disability
               seems to have been one reason for the different periods of service
               required of the two classes of bought servants&#8212;the Israelites and the
               Strangers. The Israelite was to serve six years&#8212;the Stranger until
               the jubilee<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN23"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN23"></a>.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN23"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN23">A</a>: Both classes may with propriety be
               called <i>permanent</i> servants; even the bought Israelite, when his six-years' service is contrasted with the brief term
               of the hired servant.
            </p>
            <p>
               As the Strangers could not own the soil, nor even houses, except within
               walled towns, most of them would choose to attach themselves permanently
               to Israelitish families. Those Strangers who were wealthy,
               or skilled in manufactures, instead of becoming servants themselves,
               would need servants for their own use, and as inducements for the
               Strangers to become servants to the Israelites, were greater than persons
               of their own nation could hold out to them, these wealthy Strangers
               would naturally procure the poorer Israelites for servants. See Levit.
               xxv. 47. In a word, such was the political condition of the Strangers,
               the Jewish polity furnished a strong motive to them, to become servants,
               thus incorporating themselves with the nation, and procuring those
               social and religious privileges already enumerated, and for their children
               in the second generation, a permanent inheritance. (This last
               was a regulation of later date. Ezekiel xlvii. 21-23.) Indeed, the

               structure of the whole Mosaic polity, was a virtual bounty offered to
               those who would become permanent servants, and merge in the Jewish
               system their distinct nationality. None but the monied aristocracy
               among them, would be likely to decline such offers.

            </p>
            <p>
               For various reasons, this class, (the servants bought from the Strangers,) would prefer a <em>long</em> service. They would thus more effectually
               become absorbed into the national circulation, and identify their interests
               with those in whose gift were all things desirable for themselves,
               and brighter prospects for their children. On the other hand,
               the Israelites, owning all the soil, and an inheritance of land being a sort
               of sacred possession, to hold it free of incumbrance, was, with every
               Israelite, a delicate point, both of family honor and personal character.
               1 Kings xxi. 3. Hence, to forego the <em>possession</em> of one's inheritance,
               <em>after</em> the division of the paternal domain, or to be restrained from its
               <em>control</em>, after having acceded to it, was a burden grievous to be borne.
               To mitigate, as much as possible, such a calamity, the law, instead of
               requiring the Israelite to continue a servant until the jubilee, released
               him at the end six years<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN24"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN24"></a>, as, during that time&#8212;if, of the first class&#8212;the
               partition of the patrimonial land might have taken place; or, if of
               the second, enough money might have been earned to disencumber
               his estate, and thus he might assume his station as a lord of the soil. If
               these contingencies had not occurred, then, at the end of another six
               years, the opportunity was again offered, and in the same manner until
               the jubilee. So while strong motives urged the Israelite, to discontinue
               his service as soon as the exigency had passed, which induced him to
               become a servant, every consideration impelled the <i>Stranger</i> to <em>prolong</em> his term of service; and the same kindness which dictated the law of six years' service for the Israelite, assigned as the
               general rule, a much
               longer period to the Gentile servant, who, instead of being tempted to a
               brief service, had every inducement to protract the term.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN24"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN24">A</a>: Another reason for
               protracting the service until the seventh year, seems to have been, its
               coincidence with other arrangements, and provisions, inseparable from the
               Jewish economy. That period was a favorite one in the Mosaic system. Its
               pecuniary responsibilities, social relations and general internal structure,
               if not <i>graduated</i> upon a septennial scale, were
               variously modified by the lapse of the period. Another reason doubtless was,
               that as those Israelites who became servants through poverty, would not sell
               themselves, except as a last resort when other expedients to recruit their
               finances had failed&#8212;(See Lev. xxv. 35)&#8212;their <em>becoming
                  servants</em> proclaimed such a state of their affairs, as demanded the
               labor of <em>a course of years</em> fully to reinstate
               them.
            </p>
            <p>
               It is important to a clear understanding of the whole subject, to keep
               in mind that adult Jews ordinarily became servants, only as a temporary
               expedient to relieve themselves from embarrassment, and ceased to

               be such when that object was effected. The poverty that forced them
               to it was a calamity, and their service was either a means of relief, or a
               measure of prevention. It was not pursued as a <em>permanent business</em>,
               but resorted to on emergencies&#8212;a sort of episode in the main scope of
               their lives. Whereas with the Strangers, it was a <em>permanent employment</em>, pursued not merely as a <em>means</em> of bettering their own condition,
               and prospectively that of their posterity, but also, as an <em>end</em> for its
               own sake, conferring on them privileges, and a social estimation not
               otherwise attainable.

            </p>
            <p>
               We see from the foregoing, why servants purchased from the heathen,
               are called by way of distinction, <em>the</em> servants, (not <em>bondmen</em>, as
               our translators have it.) (1.) They followed it as a <em>permanent business</em>.
               (2.) Their term of service was <em>much longer</em> than that of the other
               class. (3.) As a class, they doubtless greatly outnumbered the Israelitish
               servants. (4.) All the Strangers that dwelt in the land, were <i>tributaries</i>
               to the Israelites&#8212;required to pay an annual tribute to the government,
               either in money, or in public service, which was called a "<i>tribute
                  of bond-service</i>;" in other words, all the Strangers were <i>national
                  servants</i>, to the Israelites, and the same Hebrew word which is used to designate
               <i>individual</i> servants, equally designates <i>national</i> servants or tributaries. 2 Sam. viii. 2, 6, 14. 2 Chron. viii. 7-9. Deut. xx. 11.
               2 Sam. x. 19. 1 Kings ix. 21, 22. 1 Kings iv. 21. Gen. xxvii. 29.
               The same word is applied to the Israelites, when they paid tribute to
               other nations. See 2 Kings xvii. 3. Judges iii. 8, 14. Gen. xlix. 15.
               Another distinction between the Jewish and Gentile bought servants,
               claims notice. It was in the <em>kinds</em> of service assigned to each class.
               The servants from the Strangers, were properly the <i>domestics</i>, or household
               servants, employed in all family work, in offices of personal attendance,
               and in such mechanical labor, as was constantly required in every
               family, by increasing wants, and needed repairs. On the other hand,
               the Jewish bought servants seem to have been almost exclusively <i>agricultural</i>. Besides being better fitted for this by previous habits&#8212;agriculture,
               and the tending of cattle, were regarded by the Israelites as
               the most honorable of all occupations; kings engaged in them. After
               Saul was elected king, and escorted to Gibeah, the next report of
               him is, "<em>And behold Saul came after the herd out of the field</em>."&#8212;1
               Sam. xi. 7.

            </p>
            <p>
               Elisha "was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen" when Elijah threw
               his mantle upon him. 1 Kings xix. 19. King Uzziah "loved husbandry."
               2 Chron. xxvi. 10. Gideon, the deliverer of Israel, <em>was

                  "threshing wheat</em> by the wine press" when called to lead the host
               against the Midianites. Judges vi. 11. The superior honorableness of
               agriculture, is shown by the fact, that it was <em>protected and supported by
                  the fundamental law</em> of the theocracy&#8212;God thus indicating it as the
               chief prop of the government, and putting upon it peculiar honor. An
               inheritance of land seems to have filled out an Israelite's idea of worldly
               furnishment. They were like permanent fixtures on their soil, so did they
               cling to it. To be agriculturalists on their own inheritances, was, in
               their notions, the basis of family consequence, and the grand claim to
               honorable estimation. Agriculture being pre-eminently a <em>Jewish</em> employment,
               to assign a native Israelite to <em>other</em> employments as a <em>business</em>,
               was to break up his habits, do violence to cherished predilections, and
               put him to a kind of labor in which he had no skill, and which he
               deemed degrading. In short, it was, in the earlier ages of the Mosaic
               system, practically to <i>unjew</i> him, a hardship and rigor grievous to be
               borne, as it annihilated a visible distinction between the descendants of
               Abraham and the Strangers&#8212;a distinction vital to the system, and
               gloried in by every Jew.

            </p>
            <p><em>To guard this and another fundamental distinction</em>, God instituted the
               regulation contained in Leviticus xxv. 39, which stands at the head of
               this branch of our inquiry, "<em>If thy brother that dwelleth by thee be
                  waxen poor, and be sold unto thee, thou shalt not compel him to serve as a
                  bond-servant.</em>" In other words, thou shalt not put him to <em>servants'
                  work</em>&#8212;to the <em>business</em>, and into the <em>condition</em> of <em>domestics</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               In the Persian version it is translated thus, "Thou shalt not assign
               to him the work of <em>servitude</em>," (or <em>menial</em> labor.) In the Septuagint
               thus, "He shall not serve thee with the service of a <em>domestic or household
                  servant</em>." In the Syriac thus, "Thou shalt not employ him after
               the manner of servants." In the Samaritan thus, "Thou shalt not require
               him to serve in the service of a servant." In the Targum of Onkelos
               thus, "He shall not serve thee with the service of a household
               servant." In the Targum of Jonathan thus, "Thou shalt not cause
               him to serve according to the usages of the servitude of
               servants<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN25"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN25"></a>." In fine, "thou shalt not compel him to serve as a
               bond-servant," means,
               <em>thou shalt not assign him to the same grade, nor put him to the same services,
                  with permanent domestics.</em></p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN25"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN25">A</a>: Jarchi's comment on "Thou shalt not compel
               him to serve as a bond-servant" is, "the Hebrew servant is not to be required
               to do any thing which is accounted degrading&#8212;such as all offices of
               personal attendance, as loosing his master's shoe latchet, bringing him water
               to wash his feet and hands, waiting on him at table, dressing him, carrying
               things to and from the bath. The Hebrew servant is to work with his master as
               a son or brother, in the business of his farm, or other labor, until his
               legal release."
            </p>
            <p>
               We pass to the remainder of the regulation in the 40th verse:&#8212;

            </p>
            <p>
               "<em>But as an hired servant and as a sojourner shall he be with thee</em>."
               Hired servants were not incorporated into the families of their masters;
               they still retained their own family organization, without the surrender
               of any domestic privilege, honor, or authority; and this, even though
               they resided under the same roof with their master. While bought-servants
               were associated with their master's families at meals, at the
               Passover, and at other family festivals, hired servants and sojourners
               were not. Exodus xii. 44, 45; Lev. xxii. 10, 11. Not being merged
               in the family of his master, the hired servant was not subject to his authority,
               (except in directions about his labor) in any such sense as the
               master's wife, children, and bought servants. Hence the only form of
               oppressing hired servants spoken of in the Scriptures as practicable to
               masters, is that of <em>keeping back their wages</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               To have taken away these privileges in the case stated in the passage
               under consideration, would have been preeminent <em>rigor</em>; for the case
               described, is not that of a servant born in the house of a master, nor
               that of a minor, whose unexpired minority had been sold by the father,
               neither was it the case of an Israelite, who though of age, had not yet
               acceded to his inheritance; nor, finally, was it that of one who had received
               the <i>assignment</i> of his inheritance, but was, as a servant, working
               off from it an incumbrance, before entering upon its possession and
               control<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN26"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN26"></a>. But it was that
               of <em>the head of a family</em>, who had lived independently
               on his own inheritance, and long known better days, now reduced
               to poverty, forced to relinquish the loved inheritance of his fathers, with
               the competence and respectful consideration its possession secured to
               him, and to be indebted to a neighbor for shelter, sustenance, and employment,
               both for himself and his family. Surely so sad a reverse,
               might well claim sympathy; but there remaineth to him one consolation,
               and it cheers him in the house of his pilgrimage. He is an
               <em>Israelite&#8212;Abraham is his father</em>, and now in his calamity he clings closer
               than ever, to the distinction conferred by the immunities of his birthright.
               To rob him of this, were "the unkindest cut of all." To have
               assigned him to a <em>grade</em> of service filled only by those whose permanent
               business was <em>serving</em>, would have been to <em>rule over him with peculiar
                  rigor</em>.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN26"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN26">A</a>: These two latter classes are evidently
               referred to in Exod. xxi. 1-6, and Deut. xv. 12
            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, the former part of the regulation, "Thou shalt not compel
               him to serve as a bond-servant," or more literally, <em>thou shall not serve
                  thyself with him, with the service of a servant</em>, guaranties his political
               privileges, and secures to him a kind and grade of service, comporting
               with his character and relations as a son of Israel. And the remainder
               of the verse, "But as a <em>hired</em> servant, and as a sojourner shall he be
               with thee," continues and secures to him his separate family organization,
               the respect and authority due to his head, and the general consideration
               in society resulting from such a station. Though this individual
               was a Jewish <i>bought</i> servant, the case is peculiar, and forms an exception
               to the general class of Jewish bought servants. Being already
               in possession of his inheritance, and the head of a household, the
               law so arranged his relations, as a servant, as to <em>alleviate</em> as much as
               possible the calamity which had reduced him from independence and authority,
               to penury and subjection.

            </p>
            <p>
               Having gone so much into detail on this point, comment on the command
               which concludes this topic in the forty-third verse, would be superfluous.
               "<em>Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy
                  God</em>." As if it had been said, "In your administration you shall not
               disregard those differences in previous habits, station, authority, and national
               and political privileges, upon which this regulation is based; for
               to exercise authority over this class of servants, <em>irrespective</em> of these
               distinctions, and annihilating them, is <em>to</em><em>rule with rigor</em>." The same
               command is repeated in the forty-sixth verse, and applied to the distinction
               between the servants of Jewish, and those of Gentile extraction,
               and forbids the overlooking of distinctive Jewish peculiarities, so vital to
               an Israelite as to make the violation of them, <em>rigorous</em> in the extreme;
               while to the servants from the Strangers, whose previous habits and associations
               differed so widely from those of the Israelite, these same
               things would be deemed slight disabilities.

            </p>
            <p>
               It may be remarked here, that the political and other disabilities of
               the Strangers, which were the distinctions growing out of a different
               national descent, and important to the preservation of national characteristics,
               and to the purity of national worship, do not seem to have effected
               at all the <em>social</em> estimation, in which this class of servants was
               held. They were regarded according to their character and worth as
               <em>persons</em>, irrespective of their foreign origin, employments, and political
               condition.

               The common construction put upon the expression, "<em>rule with rigor</em>,"
               and an inference drawn from it, have an air so oracular, as quite to

               overcharge risibles of ordinary calibre, if such an effect were not forestalled
               by its impiety. It is interpreted to mean, "you shall not make
               him an article of property, you shall not force him to work, and rob him
               of his earnings, you shall not make him a chattel, and strip him of legal
               protection." So much for the interpretation. The inference is
               like unto it, viz. Since the command forbade such outrages upon the
               <em>Israelites, it permitted and commissioned</em> the infliction of them upon the
               <i>Strangers</i>. Such impious and shallow smattering, captivates two
               classes of minds, the one by its flippancy, the other by its blasphemy,
               and both, by the strong scent of its unbridled license. What boots it to
               reason against such rampant affinities!

            </p>
            <p>
               In Exodus, chap. i. 13, 14, it is said that the Egyptians "made
               the children of Israel to <em>serve</em> with rigor," "and all their <em>service</em> wherein
               they made them <em>serve</em>, was with rigor." The rigor here spoken of, is
               affirmed of the <em>amount of labor</em> extorted from them, and the <em>mode</em> of the
               exaction. This form of expression, "<em>serve with rigor</em>," is never applied
               to the service of servants either under the Patriarchal, or the Mosaic
               systems. Nor is any other form of expression ever used, either
               equivalent to it, or at all similar. The phrase, "thou shalt not RULE
               over him with rigor," used in Leviticus xxv. 43, 46, does not prohibit
               unreasonable exactions of labor, nor inflictions of personal cruelty.
               <em>Such were provided against otherwise</em>. But it forbids, confounding
               the distinctions between a Jew and a Stranger, by assigning the former
               to the same grade of service, for the same term of time, and under the
               same national and political disabilities as the latter.

               We are now prepared to survey at a glance, the general condition of
               the different classes of servants, with the modifications peculiar to each
               class. I. In the possession of <em>all fundamental rights, all classes of
                  servants were on an absolute equality</em>, all were <em>equally protected</em> by law
               in their persons, character, property and social relations. All were
               <em>voluntary</em>, all were <em>compensated</em> for their labor. All were released from
               their regular labor nearly <em>one half of the days in each year</em>, all were
               furnished with stated <em>instruction</em>; none in either class were in any sense
               articles of <em>property</em>, all were regarded as <em>men</em>, with the rights, interests,
               hopes, and destinies of <em>men</em>. In these respects the circumstances of <em>all</em>
               classes of servants among the Israelites, were not only similar but <em>identical</em>,
               and so far forth, they formed but ONE CLASS.

            </p>
            <p>
               II. DIFFERENT CLASSES OF SERVANTS.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. <i>Hired Servants</i>.&#8212;This class consisted both of Israelites and
               Strangers. Their employments were different. The <i>Israelite</i>, was an

               agricultural servant. The Stranger was a <i>domestic</i> and <i>personal</i> servant,
               and in some instances <i>mechanical</i>; both were <i>occasional</i>, procured
               <em>temporally</em> to serve an emergency. Both lived in their own families,
               their wages were <em>money</em>, and they were paid when their work was
               done. As a <em>class of servants</em>, the hired were less loved, trusted, honored
               and promoted than any other.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. <em>Bought Servants, (including those "born in the house.")</em>&#8212;This
               class also, was composed both of Israelites and Strangers, the same general
               difference obtaining in their kinds of employment as was noticed
               before. Both were paid in advance<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN27"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN27"></a>, and neither was
               temporary.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN27"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN27">A</a>: The payment
               <em>in advance</em>, doubtless lessened considerably the price of the
               purchase; the servant thus having the use of the money from the beginning, and
               the master assuming all the risks of life, and health for labor; at the
               expiration of the six years' contract, the master having
               experienced no loss from the risk incurred at the making of it, was obliged
               by law to release the servant with a liberal gratuity. The reason assigned
               for this is, "he hath been worth a double hired servant unto thee in serving
               thee six years," as if it had been said, he has now served out his time, and
               as you have experienced no loss from the risks of life, and ability
               to labor which you incurred in the purchase, and which lessened the
               price, and as, by being your permanent servant for six years, he has saved
               you all the time and trouble of looking up and hiring laborers on emergencies,
               therefore, "thou shalt furnish him liberally," &amp;c.
            </p>
            <p>
               The Israelitish servant, in most instances, was released after six years.
               (The <i>freeholder</i> continued until the jubilee.) The Stranger, was a <i>permanent</i>
               servant, continuing until the jubilee. Besides these distinctions
               between Jewish and Gentile bought servants, a marked distinction obtained
               between different classes of Jewish bought servants. Ordinarily,
               during their term of service, they were merged in their master's family,
               and, like the wife and children of the master, subject to his authority;
               (and of course, like them, protected by law from its abuse.) But <em>one</em>
               class of the Jewish bought servants was a marked exception. The <i>freeholder</i>, obliged by poverty to leave his possession, and sell himself
               as a servant, did not thereby affect his family relations, or authority,
               nor subject himself as an inferior to the control of his master, though dependent
               upon him for employment. In this respect, his condition differed
               from that of the main body of Jewish bought servants, which
               seems to have consisted of those, who had not yet come into possession
               of their inheritance, or of those who were dislodging from it an incumbrance.

            </p>
            <p>
               Having dwelt so much at length on this part of the subject, the reader's
               patience may well be spared further details. We close it with a suggestion
               or two, which may serve as a solvent of some minor difficulties, if
               such remain.

            </p>
            <p>
               I. It should be kept in mind, that <em>both</em> classes of servants, the Israelite
               and the Stranger, not only enjoyed <em>equal natural and religious rights</em>,
               but <em>all the civil and political privileges</em> enjoyed by those of their own people,
               who were <em>not</em> servants. If Israelites, all rights belonging to Israelites
               were theirs. If from the Strangers, the same political privileges enjoyed
               by those wealthy Strangers, who bought and held <i>Israelitish</i> servants,
               <em>were theirs</em>. They also shared <em>in common with them</em>, the political disabilities
               which appertained to <em>all</em> Strangers, whether the servants of Jewish
               masters, or the masters of Jewish servants.

            </p>
         </div>

            <h3><a name="E4_heathen"></a></h3>
            <p>
               II. The disabilities of the servants from the Strangers, were exclusively
               <i>political</i> and <i>national</i>.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. They, in common with all Strangers, <em>could not own the soil</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. They were <em>ineligible to civil offices</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               3. They were assigned to <em>employments</em> less honorable than those in
               which Israelitish servants engaged; agriculture being regarded as fundamental
               to the prosperity and even to the existence of the state, other employments
               were in far less repute, and deemed <i>unjewish</i>.

            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, the condition of the Strangers, whether servants or masters,
               was, as it respected political privileges, much like that of unnaturalized
               foreigners in the United States; no matter how great their wealth or intelligence,
               or moral principle, or love for our institutions, they can neither
               go to the ballot-box, nor own the soil, nor be eligible to office. Let a
               native American, who has always enjoyed these privileges, be suddenly
               bereft of them, and loaded with the disabilities of an alien, and what to
               the foreigner would be a light matter, to <em>him</em>, would be the severity of
               <em>rigor</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               The recent condition of the Jews and Catholics in England, is a still
               better illustration of the political condition of the Strangers in Israel.
               Rothschild, the late English banker, though the richest private citizen in
               the world, and perhaps master of scores of English servants, who sued
               for the smallest crumbs of his favor, was, as a subject of the government,
               inferior to the veriest scavenger among them. Suppose an Englishman,
               of the Established Church, were by law deprived of power to
               own the soil, made ineligible to office, and deprived unconditionally of
               the electoral franchise, would Englishmen think it a misapplication of
               language, if it were said, "The government rules over that man with
               rigor?" And yet his life, limbs, property, reputation, conscience, all his
               social relations, the disposal of his time, the right of locomotion at pleasure,
               and of natural liberty in all respects, are just as much protected by
               law as the Lord Chancellor's. The same was true of all "the strangers

               within the gates" among the Israelites: Whether these Strangers
               were the servants of Israelitish masters, or the masters of Israelitish servants,
               whether sojourners, or bought servants, or born in the house, or
               hired, or neither&#8212;<em>all were protected equally with the descendants of
                  Abraham.</em></p>
         </div>
         <div class="teidiv">
            <h3><a name="E4_Ex21_2"></a></h3>
            <p>
               Finally&#8212;As the Mosaic system was a great compound type, made
               up of innumerable fractional ones, each rife with meaning in doctrine
               and duty; the practical power of the whole, depended upon the exact
               observance of those distinctions and relations which constituted its significancy.
               Hence, the care everywhere shown to preserve inviolate the
               distinction between a <i>descendant of Abraham</i> and a <i>Stranger</i>, even when
               the Stranger was a proselyte, had gone through the initiatory ordinances,
               entered the congregation, and become incorporated with the Israelites
               by family alliance. The regulation laid down in Exodus xxi. 2-6, is
               an illustration, <em>"If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years shall he
                  serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. If he
                  came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married,
                  then, his wife shall go out with him. If his master have given him
                  a wife, and she have borne him sons or daughters; the wife and her
                  children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. And
                  if the servant should plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my
                  children, I will not go out free: then his master shall bring him unto
                  the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door-post;
                  and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall
                  serve him forever."</em> In this case, the Israelitish servant, whose term
               expired in six years, married one of his master's <i>permanent female domestics</i>;
               but the fact of her marriage, did not release her master from
               <em>his</em> part of the contract for her whole term of service, nor absolve him
               from his legal obligation to support and educate her children. Nor could
               it do away that distinction, which marked her national descent by a specific
               <i>grade</i> and <i>term</i> of service. Her marriage did not impair her obligation to fulfil <em>her</em> part of the contract. Her relations as a permanent
               domestic grew out of a distinction guarded with great care throughout
               the Mosaic system. To permit this to be rendered void, would have
               been to divide the system against itself. This God would not tolerate.
               Nor, on the other hand, would he permit the master, to throw off the responsibility
               of instructing her children, nor the care and expense of their
               helpless infancy and rearing. He was bound to support and educate
               them, and all her children born afterwards during her term of service.
               The whole arrangement beautifully illustrates that wise and tender regard

               for the interests of all the parties concerned, which arrays the Mosaic
               system in robes of glory, and causes it to shine as the sun in the
               kingdom of our Father. By this law, the children had secured to them
               a mother's tender care. If the husband loved his wife and children, he
               could compel his master to keep him, whether he had any occasion for
               his services or not, and with such remuneration as was provided by the
               statute. If he did not love them, to be rid of him was a blessing; and in
               that case, the regulation would prove an act for the relief of an afflicted
               family. It is not by any means to be inferred, that the release of the servant
               from his service in the seventh year, either absolved him from the
               obligations of marriage, or shut him out from the society of his family.
               He could doubtless procure a service at no great distance from them,
               and might often do it, to get higher wages, or a kind of employment better
               suited to his taste and skill, or because his master might not have
               sufficient work to occupy him. Whether he lived near his family, or
               at a considerable distance, the great number of days on which the law
               released servants from regular labor, would enable him to spend much
               more time with them than can be spent by most of the agents of our benevolent
               societies with <em>their</em> families, or by many merchants, editors,
               artists, &amp;c., whose daily business is in New York, while their families
               reside from ten to one hundred miles in the country.

            <p>
               We conclude this Inquiry by touching briefly upon an objection,
               which, though not formally stated, has been already set aside by the
               whole tenor of the foregoing argument. It is this,&#8212;

            </p>
            <p><em>"The slavery of the Canaanites by the Israelites, was appointed by
                  God as a commutation of the punishment of death denounced against
                  them for their sins."</em>&#8212;If the absurdity of a sentence consigning persons
               to <em>death</em>, and at the same time to perpetual <em>slavery</em>, did not sufficiently
               laugh in its own face, it would be small self-denial, in a case so tempting,
               to make up the deficiency by a general contribution. For, <em>be it remembered</em>,
               the Mosaic law was given, while Israel was <em>in the wilderness</em>, and
               only <em>one</em> statute was ever given respecting <em>the disposition to be made of
                  the inhabitants of the land.</em> If the sentence of death was first pronounced
               against them, and afterwards <em>commuted</em>, when? where? by whom?
               and in what terms was the commutation? And where is it recorded?
               Grant, for argument's sake, that all the Canaanites were sentenced to
               unconditional extermination; as there was no reversal of the sentence,
               how can a right to <em>enslave</em> them, be drawn from such premises? The
               punishment of death is one of the highest recognitions of man's moral
               nature possible. It proclaims him <em>man</em>&#8212;intelligent accountable, guilty
               <em>man,</em> deserving death for having done his utmost to cheapen human life,
               and make it worthless, when the proof of its priceless value, lives in his
               own nature. But to make him a <em>slave,</em> cheapens to nothing <em>universal
                  human nature,</em> and instead of healing a wound, gives a death stab.
               What! repair an injury done to rational being in the robbery of <em>one</em> of
               its rights, not merely by robbing it of <em>all,</em> but by annihilating the very
               <em>foundation</em> of them&#8212;that everlasting distinction between men and
               things? To make a man a chattel, is not the <em>punishment,</em> but the <em>annihilation</em>
               of a <em>human</em> being, and, so far as it goes, of <em>all</em> human beings.
               This commutation of the punishment of death, into perpetual slavery,
               what a fortunate discovery! Alas! for the honor of Deity, if commentators
               had not manned the forlorn hope, and rushed to the rescue of the
               Divine character at the very crisis of its fate, and, by a timely movement,
               covered its retreat from the perilous position in which inspiration had
               carelessly left it! Here a question arises of sufficient importance for a
               separate dissertation; but must for the present be disposed of in a few
               paragraphs. WERE THE CANAANITES SENTENCED BY GOD TO INDIVIDUAL
               AND UNCONDITIONAL EXTERMINATION? That the views generally
               prevalent on this subject, are wrong, we have no doubt; but as
               the limits of this Inquiry forbid our going into the merits of the question,
               so as to give all the grounds of dissent from the commonly received
               opinions, the suggestions made, will be thrown out merely as QUERIES,
               and not as a formal laying down of <i>doctrines</i>.

            </p>
            <p>
               The leading directions as to the disposal of the Canaanites, are mainly
               in the following passages, Exod. xxiii. 23-33, and 33-51, and 34,
               11&#8212;Deut. vii. 16-25, and ix. 3, and xxxi. 3, 1, 2. In these verses,
               the Israelites are commanded to "destroy the Canaanites"&#8212;to "drive
               out,"&#8212;"consume,"&#8212;"utterly overthrow,"&#8212;"put out,"&#8212;"dispossess
               them," &amp;c. Quest. Did these commands enjoin the unconditional and
               universal destruction of the <em>individuals,</em> or merely of the <i>body politic?</i>
               Ans. The Hebrew word <i>Haram,</i> to destroy, signifies <i>national,</i> as well
               as individual destruction; <i>political</i> existence, equally with <i>personal;</i> the
               destruction of governmental organization, equally with the lives of the
               subjects. Besides, if we interpret the words destroy, consume, overthrow,
               &amp;c., to mean <i>personal</i> destruction, what meaning shall we give
               to the expressions, "drive out before thee;" "cast out before thee;"
               "expel," "put out," "dispossess," &amp;c., which are used in the same
               passages?

            </p>
            <p>
               For a clue to the sense in which the word <em>"destroy"</em> is used, see
               Exodus xxiii. 27. "I will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt

               come, and I will make all thine enemies <em>turn their backs unto thee</em>."
               Here "<em>all their enemies</em>" were to <em>turn their backs</em>, and "<em>all the people</em>" to be
               "<em>destroyed</em>". Does this mean that God would let all their <em>enemies</em> escape,
               but kill all their <em>friends</em>, or that he would <em>first</em> kill "all the people"
               and THEN make them turn their backs in flight, an army of runaway corpses?

            </p>
            <p>
               The word rendered <em>backs</em>, is in the original, <em>necks</em>, and the passage
               <em>may</em> mean, I will make all your enemies turn their necks unto you;
               that is, be <em>subject to you as tributaries</em>, become <i>denationalized</i>, their
               civil polity, state organization, political existence, <em>destroyed</em>&#8212;their idolatrous
               temples, altars, images, groves, and all heathen rites <em>destroyed</em>; in a
               word, their whole system, national, political, civil, and religious, subverted,
               and the whole people <em>put under tribute</em>. Again; if these commands
               required the unconditional destruction of all the <em>individuals</em> of the Canaanites,
               the Mosaic law was at war with itself, for the directions relative
               to the treatment of native residents and sojourners, form a large part
               of it. "The stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one
               born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself." "If thy brother
               be waxen poor, thou shalt relieve him, yea, though he be a <em>stranger or
                  a sojourner</em>, that he may live with thee." "Thou shalt not oppress a
               <em>stranger</em>." "Thou shalt not vex a <em>stranger</em>." "Judge righteously between
               every, man and his brother, and the <em>stranger</em> that is with him."
               "Ye shall not respect persons in judgement." "Ye shall have one
               manner of law as well for the <em>stranger</em>, as for him of your own country."
               We find, also, that provision was made for them in the cities of
               refuge. Num. xxxv. 15&#8212;the gleanings of the harvest and vintage were
               assigned to them, Lev. xix. 9, 10, and xxiii. 22, and 25, 6;&#8212;the blessings
               of the Sabbath, theirs, Ex. xx. 10;&#8212;the privilege of offering sacrifices
               secured, Lev. 22. 18; and stated religious instruction provided
               for them. Deut. xxxi. 9, 12. Now, does this <em>same law</em> authorize and
               appoint the <em>individual extermination</em> of those very persons, whose lives
               and general interests it so solicitously protects? These laws were
               given to the Israelites, long <em>before</em> they entered Canaan; and they
               must of necessity have inferred from them, that a multitude of the inhabitants
               of the land would <em>continue in it</em>, under their government.

            </p>
            <p>
               3. <em>We argue that these commands did not require the</em> INDIVIDUAL <em>destruction
                  of the Canaanites unconditionally, from the fact that the most
                  pious Israelites never seem to have so regarded them.</em> Joshua was selected
               as the leader of Israel to execute God's threatenings upon Canaan.
               He had no <em>discretionary</em> power. God's commands were his
               <em>official instructions.</em> Going <em>beyond</em> them would have been usurpation;
               refusing <em>to carry them out,</em> rebellion and treason. For not obeying, in
               <em>every particular,</em> and in a <em>single</em> instance, God's command respecting
               the Amalekites, Saul was rejected from being king.

            </p>
            <p>
               Now, if God commanded the individual destruction of all the Canaanitish
               nations, Joshua <em>disobeyed him in every instance.</em> For at his death,
               the Israelites still <em>"dwelt among them,"</em> and each nation is mentioned
               by name. See Judges i. 5, and yet we are told that "Joshua was full
               of the spirit of the Lord and of WISDOM," Deut. xxxiv. 9. (of course,
               he could not have been ignorant of the meaning of those commands,)&#8212;that
               "the Lord was with him," Josh. vi. 27; and that he "left nothing
               undone of all that the Lord commanded Moses;" and further, that he
               "took all that land." Joshua xi, 15-23. Also, that "the Lord gave
               unto Israel all the land which he swore to give unto their fathers, and
               they possessed it and dwelt therein, and there <em>stood not a man</em> of <em>all</em>
               their enemies before them." "The Lord delivered <em>all their</em> enemies
               into their hand," &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               How can this testimony be reconciled with itself, if we suppose that
               the command to <em>destroy</em> enjoined <em>individual</em> extermination, and the
               command to <em>drive out</em>, enjoined the unconditional expulsion of individuals
               from the country, rather than their expulsion from the <em>possession</em> or
               <em>ownership</em> of it, as the lords of the soil? It is true, multitudes of the
               Canaanites were slain, but in every case it was in consequence of their
               refusing to surrender their land to the possession of the Israelites.
               Not a solitary case can be found in which a Canaanite was either killed
               or driven out of the country, who acquiesced in the transfer of the territory
               of Canaan, and its sovereignty, from the inhabitants of the land to
               the Israelites. Witness the case of Rahab and all her kindred, and the
               inhabitants of Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and
               Kirjathjearim<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN28a"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN28a"></a>. The

               Canaanites knew of the miracles in Egypt, at the Red Sea, in the wilderness,
               and at the passage of Jordan. They knew that their land had
               been transferred to the Israelites, as a judgment upon them for their
               sins.&#8212;See Joshua ii. 9-11, and ix. 9, 10, 24. Many of them were
               awed by these wonders, and made no resistance to the confiscation of
               their territory. Others fiercely resisted, defied the God of the armies
               of Israel, and came out to battle. These occupied the <i>fortified cities</i>,
               were the most <em>inveterate</em> heathen&#8212;the <em>aristocracy</em> of idolatry, the <em>kings</em>,
               the <em>nobility</em> and <em>gentry</em>, the <em>priests</em>, with their crowds of satellites, and
               retainers that aided in the performance of idolatrous rites, the <em>military
                  forces</em>, with the chief profligates and lust-panders of both sexes. Every
               Bible student will recall many facts corroborating this supposition. Such
               as the multitudes of <i>tributaries</i> in the midst of Israel, and that too, when
               the Israelites had "waxed strong," and the uttermost nations quaked at
               the terror of their name. The large numbers of the Canaanites, as
               well as the Philistines and others, who became proselytes, and joined
               themselves to the Hebrews&#8212;as the Nethenims, Uriah the Hittite, one
               of David's memorable "thirty seven"&#8212;Rahab, who married one of the
               princes of Judah&#8212;Ittai&#8212;The six hundred Gitites&#8212;David's bodyguard,
               "faithful among the faithless."&#8212;2 Sam. xv. 18, 21. Obededom the
               Gittite, who was adopted into the tribe of Levi.&#8212;Compare 2 Sam. vi.
               10, 11, with 1 Chron. xv. 18, and 1 Chron xxvi. 45. The cases of Jaziz,
               and Obil,&#8212;1 Chron. xxvi. 30, 31, 33. Jephunneh, the father of Caleb&#8212;the
               Kenite, registered in the genealogies of the tribe of Judah, and
               the one hundred and fifty thousand Canaanites, employed by Solomon
               in the building of the Temple<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN28b"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN28b"></a>. Add to
               these, the fact that the most
               memorable miracle on record, was wrought for the salvation of a portion
               of those very Canaanites, and for the destruction of those who would exterminate
               them.&#8212;Joshua x. 12-14. Further&#8212;the terms used in the
               directions of God to the Israelites, regulating their disposal of the Canaanites,
               such as, "drive out," "put out," "cast out," "expel," "dispossess,"
               &amp;c. seem used interchangeably with "consume," "destroy,"
               "overthrow," &amp;c., and thus indicate the sense in which the latter words

               are used. As an illustration of the meaning generally attached to these
               and similar terms, when applied to the Canaanites in Scripture, we refer
               the reader to the history of the Amalekites. In Ex. xxvii. 14, God
               says, "I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under
               heaven,"&#8212;In Deut. xxv. 19, "Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of
               Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget it."&#8212;In 1 Sam. xv.
               2, 3. "Smite Amalek and <em>utterly destroy</em> all that they have, and spare
               them not, but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox
               and sheep." In the seventh and eighth verses of the same chapter,
               we are told, "Saul smote the Amalekites, and took Agag the king
               of the Amalekites, alive, and UTTERLY DESTROYED ALL THE PEOPLE
               with the edge of the sword." In verse 20, Saul says, "I have obeyed
               the voice of the Lord, and have brought Agag, the king of Amalek,
               and have <em>utterly destroyed</em> the Amalekites."

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN28a"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN28a">A</a>: Perhaps it will be objected, that the
               preservation of the Gibeonites, and of Rahab and her kindred, was a violation
               of the command of God. We answer, if it had been, we might expect some such
               intimation. If God had straitly commanded them to <em>exterminate all the
                  Canaanites,</em> their pledge to save them alive, was neither a repeal of
               the statute, nor absolution for the breach of it. If <em>unconditional
                  destruction</em> was the import of the command, would God have permitted
               such an act to pass without severe rebuke? Would he have established such
               a precedent when Israel had hardly passed the threshhold of Canaan, and was
               then striking the first blow of a half century war? What if they
               <em>had</em> passed their word to Rahab and the Gibeonites? Was that more
               binding upon them than God's command? So Saul seems to have passed
               <em>his</em> word to Agag; yet Samuel hewed him in pieces, because in
               saving his life, Saul had violated God's command. This same Saul appears to
               have put the same construction on the command to destroy the inhabitants of
               Canaan, that is generally put upon it now. We are told that he sought to slay
               the Gibeonites "in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah." God sent
               upon Israel a three years' famine for it. In assigning the reason, he says,
               "It is for Saul and his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites."
               When David inquired of them what atonement he should make, they say, "The man
               that consumed us, and that devised against us, that we should the destroyed
               from <em>remaining in any of the coasts of Israel</em> let seven of his
               sons be delivered," &amp;c. 2 Samuel xxii. 1-6.
            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN28b"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN28b">B</a>: If the Canaanites were
               devoted by God to individual and unconditional extermination,
               to have employed them in the erection of the temple,&#8212;what was it but
               the climax of impiety? As well might they pollute its altars with swine's
               flesh, or make their sons pass through the fire to Moloch.
            </p>
            <p>
               In 1 Sam. 30th chapter, we find the Amalekites at war again,
               marching an army into Israel, and sweeping every thing before them&#8212;and
               all this in hardly more than twenty years after they had <em>all been</em>
               UTTERLY DESTROYED!

            </p>
            <p>
               Deut. xx. 16, 17, will probably be quoted against the preceding
               view. "<em>But of the cities of these people which the Lord thy God
                  doth give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that
                  breatheth: but thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and
                  the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perrizites, the Hivites, and the
                  Jebusites, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee</em>." We argue
               that this command to exterminate, did not include all the individuals of
               the Canaanitish nations, but only the inhabitants of the <em>cities</em>, (and even
               those conditionally,) for the following reasons.

            </p>
            <p>
               I. Only the inhabitants of <em>cities</em> are specified,&#8212;"of the <em>cities</em> of these
               people thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth." The reasons for
               this wise discrimination were, no doubt, (1.) Cities then, as now, were
               pest-houses of vice&#8212;they reeked with abominations little practiced in
               the country. On this account, their influence would be far more perilous
               to the Israelites than that of the country. (2.) These cities
               were the centres of idolatry&#8212;the residences of the priests, with their
               retinues of the baser sort. There were their temples and altars, and
               idols, without number. Even their buildings, streets, and public walks
               were so many visibilities of idolatry. The reason assigned in the 18th
               verse for exterminating them, strengthens the idea,&#8212;"<em>that they teach
                  you not to do after all the abominations which they have done unto their

                  gods</em>." This would be a reason for exterminating <em>all</em> the nations and
               individuals <em>around</em> them, as all were idolaters; but God permitted, and
               even commanded them, in certain cases, to spare the inhabitants. Contact
               with <em>any</em> of them would be perilous&#8212;with the inhabitants of the
               <em>cities</em> peculiarly, and of the <em>Canaanitish</em> cities preeminently so.

            </p>
            <p>
               It will be seen from the 10th and 11th verses, that those cities which
               accepted the offer of peace were to be spared. "<em>When thou comest
                  nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it. And it
                  shall be, if it make thee answer of peace and open unto thee, then it shall
                  be, that all the people that is found therein shall be</em> TRIBUTARIES <em>unto
                  thee, and they shall</em> SERVE thee."&#8212;Deuteronomy xx. 10, 11. These
               verses contain the general rule prescribing the method in which cities
               were to be summoned to surrender.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. The offer of peace&#8212;if it was accepted, the inhabitants became
               <i>tributaries</i>&#8212;if it was rejected, and they came out against Israel in battle,
               the <em>men</em> were to be killed, and the women and little ones saved
               alive. See Deuteronomy xx. 12, 13, 14. The 15th verse restricts
               their lenient treatment in saving the wives and little ones of those who
               fought them, to the inhabitants of the cities <em>afar off</em>. The 16th verse
               gives directions for the disposal of the inhabitants of Canaanitish cities,
               after they had taken them. Instead of sparing the women and children,
               they were to save alive nothing that breathed. The common
               mistake has been, in taking it for granted, that the command in the 15th
               verse, "Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities," &amp;c. refers to the <em>whole system
                  of directions preceding</em>, commencing with the 10th verse, whereas
               it manifestly refers only to the <em>inflictions</em> specified in the verses immediately
               preceding, viz. the 12th, 13th, and 14th, and thus make a distinction
               between those <em>Canaanitish</em> cities that <em>fought</em>, and the cities <em>afar
                  off</em> that fought&#8212;in one case destroying the males and females, and in
               the other, the <em>males</em> only. The offer of peace, and the <i>conditional preservation</i>,
               were as really guarantied to <em>Canaanitish</em> cities as to others.
               Their inhabitants were not to be exterminated <em>unless they came out
                  against Israel in battle</em>. But let us settle this question by the "<em>law
                  and the testimony</em>." Joshua xix. 19, 20.&#8212;"<em>There was not a city that
                  made peace with the children of Israel save, the Hivites, the inhabitants of
                  Gibeon; all others they took in battle. For it was of the Lord to harden
                  their hearts, that they should</em> COME OUT AGAINST ISRAEL IN BATTLE,
               <em>that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favor, but
                  that he might destroy them, as the Lord commanded Moses</em>." That is, if

               they had <em>not</em> come out against Israel in battle, they would have had
               "favor" shown them, and would not have been "<em>destroyed utterly</em>"

            </p>
            <p>
               The great design of God seems to have been to <em>transfer the territory</em>
               of the Canaanites to the Israelites, and along with it, <em>absolute sovereignty
                  in every respect</em>; to annihilate their political organizations, civil polity,
               jurisprudence, and their system of religion, with all its rights and appendages;
               and to substitute therefor, a pure theocracy, administered by
               Jehovah, with the Israelites as His representatives and agents. Those
               who resisted the execution of Jehovah's purpose were to be killed, while
               those who quietly submitted to it were to be spared. All had the choice
               of these alternatives, either free egress out of the land<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4_FN29"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4_FN29"></a>; or acquiescence
               in the decree, with life and residence as tributaries, under the
               protection of the government; or resistance to the execution of the decree,
               with death. "<em>And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently
                  learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, the Lord liveth, as
                  they taught my people to swear by Baal;</em> THEN SHALL THEY BE BUILT
               IN THE MIDST OF MY PEOPLE."

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4_FN29"></a><a href="#FootE4_FN29">A</a>: Suppose all the Canaanitish nations had abandoned their territory at the
               tidings of Israel's approach, did God's command require the Israelites to
               chase them to the ends of the earth, and hunt them down, until every Canaanite
               was destroyed? It is too preposterous for belief, and yet it follows
               legitimately from that construction, which interprets the terms "consume,"
               "destroy," "destroy utterly," &amp;c. to mean unconditional individual
               extermination.

         [The preceding Inquiry is merely an <em>outline</em>. Whoever <em>reads</em> it,
         needs no such information. Its original design embraced a much
         wider range of general topics, and subordinate heads, besides an Inquiry
         into the teachings of the New Testament on the same subject. To
         have filled up the outline, in conformity with the plan upon which it
         was sketched, would have swelled it to a volume. Much of the foregoing
         has therefore been thrown into the form of a mere skeleton of
         heads, or rather a series of <em>indices</em>, to trains of thought and classes of
         proof, which, however limited or imperfect, may perhaps, afford some
         facilities to those who have little leisure for minute and protracted investigation.]

            THE BIBLE AGAINST SLAVERY.
            <br><br></p>
         <p>
            The spirit of slavery never seeks shelter in the Bible, of its own
            accord. It grasps the horns of the altar only in desperation&#8212;rushing
            from the terror of the avenger's arm. Like other unclean spirits, it
            "hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest its deeds should
            be reproved." Goaded to phrenzy in its conflicts with conscience
            and common sense, denied all quarter, and hunted from every covert,
            it vaults over the sacred inclosure and courses up and down the Bible,
            "seeking rest, and finding none." THE LAW OF LOVE, glowing on
            every page, flashes around it an omnipresent anguish and despair.
            It shrinks from the hated light, and howls under the consuming touch,
            as demons quailed before the Son of God, and shrieked, "Torment us
            not." At last, it slinks away under the types of the Mosaic system,
            and seeks to burrow out of sight among their shadows. Vain hope!
            Its asylum is its sepulchre; its city of refuge, the city of destruction.
            It flies from light into the sun; from heat, into devouring fire; and
            from the voice of God into the thickest of His thunders.

            <h3><a name="E4r3_def"></a>
               DEFINITION OF SLAVERY.

            </h3>
            <p><a name="E4r3_def_neg"></a>
               If we would know whether the Bible sanctions slavery, we must
               determine <em>what slavery is</em>. A constituent element, is one thing; a
               relation, another; an appendage, another. Relations and appendages
               presuppose <em>other</em> things to which they belong. To regard them as
               <em>the things themselves</em>, or as constituent parts of them, leads to endless
               fallacies. A great variety of conditions, relations, and tenures,

               indispensable to the social state, are confounded with slavery; and
               thus slaveholding becomes quite harmless, if not virtuous. We will
               specify some of these.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. <em>Privation of suffrage.</em> Then minors are slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. <em>Ineligibility to office.</em> Then females are slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               3. <em>Taxation without representation.</em> Then slaveholders in the
               District of Columbia are slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               4. <em>Privation of one's oath in law.</em> Then disbelievers in a future
               retribution are slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               5. <em>Privation of trial by jury.</em> Then all in France and Germany
               are slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               6. <em>Being required to support a particular religion.</em> Then the people
               of England are slaves. [To the preceding may be added all
               other disabilities, merely <em>political</em>.]

            </p>
            <p>
               7. <em>Cruelty and oppression.</em> Wives, children, and hired domestics
               are often oppressed; but these forms of cruelty are not slavery.

            </p>
            <p>
               8. <em>Apprenticeship.</em> The rights and duties of master and apprentice
               are correlative and reciprocal. The claim of each upon the other
               results from his <em>obligation</em> to the other. Apprenticeship is based on
               the principle of equivalent for value received. The rights of the
               apprentice are secured, equally with those of the master. Indeed,
               while the law is <em>just</em> to the master, it is <em>benevolent</em> to the apprentice.
               Its main design is rather to benefit the apprentice than the master.
               It promotes the interests of the former, while in doing it, it guards
               from injury those of the latter. To the master it secures a mere legal
               compensation&#8212;to the apprentice, both a legal compensation and a
               virtual gratuity in addition, he being of the two the greatest gainer.
               The law not only recognizes the <em>right</em> of the apprentice to a reward
               for his labor, but appoints the wages, and enforces the payment.
               The master's claim covers only the services of the apprentice. The
               apprentice's claim covers <em>equally</em> the services of the master. Neither
               can hold the other as property; but each holds property in the services
               of the other, and BOTH EQUALLY. Is this slavery?

               9. <em>Filial subordination and parental claims.</em> Both are nature's
               dictates and intrinsic elements of the social state; the natural
               affections which blend parent and child in one, excite each to discharge
               those offices incidental to the relation, and constitute a shield for
               mutual protection. The parent's legal claim to the child's services,
               while a minor, is a slight return for the care and toil of his rearing,

               to say nothing of outlays for support and education. This provision
               is, with the mass of mankind, indispensable to the preservation of the
               family state. The child, in helping his parents, helps himself&#8212;increases
               a common stock, in which he has a share; while his most
               faithful services do but acknowledge a debt that money cannot cancel.

            <p>
               10. <em>Bondage for crime.</em> Must innocence be punished because
               guilt suffers penalties? True, the criminal works for the government
               without pay; and well he may. He owes the government. A century's
               work would not pay its drafts on him. He is a public defaulter,
               and will die so. Because laws make men pay their debts, shall those
               be forced to pay who owe nothing? The law makes no criminal,
               PROPERTY. It restrains his liberty, and makes him pay something,
               a mere penny in the pound, of his debt to the government; but it
               does not make him a chattel. Test it. To own property, is to own
               its product. Are children born of convicts, government property?
               Besides, can <em>property</em> be guilty? Are chattels punished?

            </p>
            <p>
               11. <em>Restraints upon freedom.</em> Children are restrained by
               parents&#8212;pupils, by teachers&#8212;patients, by physicians&#8212;corporations, by
               charters&#8212;and legislatures, by constitutions. Embargoes, tariffs, quarantine,
               and all other laws, keep men from doing as they please. Restraints
               are the web of society, warp and woof. Are they slavery?
               then civilized society is a giant slave&#8212;a government of LAW, <em>the
                  climax of slavery,</em> and its executive, a king among slaveholders.

            </p>
            <p>
               12. <em>Compulsory service.</em> A juryman is empannelled against his
               will, and sit he must. A sheriff orders his posse; bystanders <em>must</em>
               turn in. Men are <em>compelled</em> to remove nuisances, pay fines and taxes,
               support their families, and "turn to the right as the law directs,"
               however much against their wills. Are they therefore slaves? To
               confound slavery with involuntary service is absurd. Slavery is a
               <em>condition</em>. The slave's <em>feelings</em> toward it, are one thing; the condition
               itself, is another thing; his feelings cannot alter the nature of that
               condition. Whether he desires or detests it, the condition remains the
               same. The slave's willingness to be a slave is no palliation of
               the slaveholder's guilt. Suppose the slave should think himself a
               chattel, and consent to be so regarded by others, does that <em>make</em>
               him a chattel, or make those guiltless who <em>hold</em> him as such? I
               may be sick of life, and I tell the assassin so that stabs me; is
               he any the less a murderer? Does my <em>consent</em> to his crime, atone
               for it? my partnership in his guilt, blot out his part of it? The

               slave's willingness to be a slave, so far from lessening the guilt of
               the "owner," aggravates it. If slavery has so palsied his mind that
               he looks upon himself as a chattel, and consents to be one, actually
               to hold him as such, falls in with his delusion, and confirms the
               impious falsehood. These very feelings and convictions of the slave,
               (if such were possible) increase a hundred fold the guilt of the master,
               and call upon him in thunder, immediately to recognize him as a
               man and thus break the sorcery that cheats him out of his
               birthright&#8212;the consciousness of his worth and destiny.

               Many of the foregoing conditions are <i>appendages</i> of slavery. But
               no one, nor all of them together, constitute its intrinsic unchanging
               element.

               MY <em>self</em>, they are figures of

               is <em>insurrection</em>. In a word, the <em>profit</em> of his master is made the END
               of his being, and he, a <em>mere means</em> to that end&#8212;a
               <em>mere means</em> to an

               That this is American slavery, is shown by the laws of slave
               states. Judge Stroud, in his "Sketch of the Laws relating to
               Slavery," says, "The cardinal principle of slavery, that the slave is
               not to be ranked among sentient beings, but among <em>things</em>&#8212;obtains
               as undoubted law in all of these [the slave] states." The law of
               South Carolina thus lays down the principle, "Slaves shall be deemed,
               held, taken, reputed, and adjudged in law to be chattels personal in
               the hands of their owners and possessors, and their executors, administrators,
               and assigns, to ALL INTENTS, CONSTRUCTIONS, AND PURPOSES
               WHATSOEVER."&#8212;Brevard's Digest, 229. In Louisiana, "A
               slave is one who is in the power of a master to whom he belongs;
               the master may sell him, dispose of his person, his industry, and his
               labor; he can do nothing, possess nothing, nor acquire any thing, but
               what must belong to his master."&#8212;Civ. Code of Louisiana, Art. 35.

               Having stated the <em>principle</em> of American slavery, we ask, DOES
               THE BIBLE SANCTION SUCH A PRINCIPLE?<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN2"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN2"></a> "To the <em>law</em> and the
               <em>testimony</em>?" First, the moral law. Just after the Israelites were
               emancipated from their bondage in Egypt, while they stood before
               Sinai to receive the law, as the trumpet waxed louder, and the
               mount quaked and blazed, God spake the ten commandments from
               the midst of clouds and thunderings. <em>Two</em> of those commandments
               deal death to slavery. "THOU SHALT NOT STEAL," or, "thou shalt
               not take from another what belongs to him." All man's powers are
               God's gift to <em>him</em>. That they are <em>his own</em>, is proved from the fact
               that God has given them to <em>him alone</em>,&#8212;that each of them is a part
               of himself, and all of them together constitute himself. All else that
               belongs to man, is acquired by the <em>use</em> of these powers. The interest
               belongs to him, because the principal does; the product is his, because
               he is the producer. Ownership of any thing, is ownership of its <em>use</em>.
               The right to use according to will, is <em>itself</em> ownership. The eighth
               commandment presupposes and assumes the right of every man to
               his powers, and their product. Slavery robs of both. A man's right
               to himself, is the only right absolutely original and intrinsic&#8212;his
               right to whatever else that belongs to him is merely <em>relative</em> to this,
               is derived from it, and held only by virtue of it. SELF-RIGHT is the
               <em>foundation right</em>&#8212;the <em>post is the middle</em>, to which all other rights are
               fastened. Slaveholders, when talking about their RIGHT to their
               slaves, always assume their own right to themselves. What slaveholder
               ever undertook to prove his right to himself? He knows it
               to be a self-evident proposition, that <em>a man belongs to himself</em>&#8212;that
               the right is intrinsic and absolute. In making out his own title, he
               makes out the title of every human being. As the fact of being a
               <em>man</em> is itself the title, the whole human family have one common title
               deed. If one man's title is valid, all are valid. If one is worthless,
               all are. To deny the validity of the <em>slave's</em> title is to deny the
               validity of <em>his own</em>; and yet in the act of making a man a slave, the
               slaveholder <em>asserts</em> the validity of his own title, while he seizes him
               as his property who has the <em>same</em> title. Further, in making him a
               slave, he does not merely disfranchise the humanity of <em>one</em> individual,
               but of UNIVERSAL MAN. He destroys the foundations. He annihilates
               <em>all rights</em>. He attacks not only the human race, but <em>universal

                  being</em>, and rushes upon JEHOVAH. For rights are <em>rights</em>; God's are no more&#8212;man's are no less.

               Lot's incest, and the lies of Jacob and his mother&#8212;not only single acts, but <em>usages</em>, such as polygamy and concubinage, are entered on the
               record without censure. Is that <em>silent entry</em> God's <em>endorsement</em>? Because the Bible in its catalogue of human
               actions, does not stamp on every crime its name and number, and write against it,
               <i>this is a crime</i>&#8212;does that wash out its guilt, and bleach into a virtue?

               The eighth commandment forbids the taking of <em>any part</em> of that
               which belongs to another. Slavery takes the <em>whole</em>. Does the same
               Bible which prohibits the taking of <em>any</em> thing from him, sanction
               the taking of <em>every</em> thing? Does it thunder wrath against him
               who robs his neighbor of a <em>cent</em>, yet bid God speed to him who
               robs his neighbor of <em>himself</em>? Slaveholding is the highest
               possible violation of the eighth commandment. To take from a man his
               earnings, is theft. But to take the <em>earner</em>, is a compound,
               life-long theft&#8212;supreme robbery, that vaults up the climax at a
               leap&#8212;the dread, terrific, giant robbery, that towers among other
               robberies a solitary horror, monarch of the realm.
               The eighth commandment forbids the taking away, and the <em>tenth</em>
               adds, <a name="E4r3_mor_covet"></a>"THOU SHALT NOT COVET ANY THING THAT IS THY
               NEIGHBOR'S;" thus guarding every man's right to himself and his property,
               by making not only the actual taking away a sin, but even that state of mind
               which would <em>tempt</em> to it. Who ever made human beings slaves,
               without <em>coveting</em> them? Why take from them their time, labor,
               liberty, right of self-preservation and improvement, their right to
               acquire property, to worship according to conscience; to search the
               Scriptures, to live with their families, and their right to their own
               bodies, if they do not <em>desire</em> them? They covet them for purposes
               of gain, convenience, lust of dominion, of sensual gratification of pride and
               ostentation. THEY BREAK THE TENTH COMMANDMENT, and pluck down upon their
               heads the plagues that are written in the book.&#8212;<em>Ten</em>
               commandments constitute the brief compend of human
               duty.&#8212;<em>Two</em> of these brand slavery as sin.

               arm, that whelmed the monarch and his hosts, and strewed
               their corpses on the sea. All this their eyes had looked upon,&#8212;earth's
               proudest city, wasted and thunder-scarred, lying in desolation,
               and the doom of oppressors traced on her ruins in the hand writing
               of God, glaring in letters of fire mingled with blood&#8212;a blackened
               monument of wrath to the uttermost against the stealers of men. No
               wonder that God, in a code of laws prepared for such a people at
               such a time, should light up on its threshold a blazing beacon to flash
               terror on slaveholders. <em>"He that stealeth a man and selleth him, or if
                  he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death."</em> Ex. xxi. 16.

            <p><a name="NoteE4r3_FN3"></a><a href="#FootE4r3_FN3">A</a>:  Jarchi, the most eminent of the Jewish
               Commentators, who wrote seven hundred years ago, in his commentary on this
               stealing and making merchandize of men, gives the meaning thus:&#8212;"Using
               a man against his will, as a servant lawfully purchased; yea, though he
               should use his services ever so little, only to the value of a farthing,
               or use but his arm to lean on to support him, <em>if he be forced so to
                  act as a servant</em>, the person compelling him but once to do so shall
               die as a thief, whether he has sold him or not."
            </p>
            <p>
               The word <i>G&#257;n&#257;bh</i> here
               rendered <i>stealeth</i>, means the taking what
               <em>belongs</em> to another, whether by violence or fraud; the same word
               is used in the eighth commandment, and prohibits both <em>robbery</em> and
               theft.

            </p>
            <p>
               The crime specified is that of depriving SOMEBODY of the ownership
               of a man. Is this somebody a master? and is the crime that of
               depriving a master of his servant? Then it would have been "he
               that stealeth" a <em>servant, not</em> "he that stealeth a
               <em>man</em>." If the crime had been the taking an individual from
               <em>another</em>, then the <em>term</em> used
               would have been expressive of that relation, and most especially if
               it was the relation of property and <em>proprietor</em>!

            </p>
            <p>
               The crime is stated in a three-fold form&#8212;man <em>stealing</em>,
               <em>selling</em>, and
               <em>holding</em>. All are put on a level, and whelmed under one
               penalty&#8212;DEATH. This <em>somebody</em> deprived of the
               ownership of a man, is the <em>man himself</em>, robbed of personal
               ownership. Joseph said, "Indeed I was <em>stolen</em> away out of the
               land of the Hebrews." Gen. xl. 15. How <em>stolen?</em> His brethren
               sold him as an article of merchandize. Contrast this penalty for
               <em>man</em>-stealing with that for <em>property</em>-stealing,
               Ex. xxii. If a man had stolen an <em>ox</em> and killed or sold it,
               he was to restore five oxen; if he had neither sold nor killed it, two
               oxen. But in the case of stealing a <em>man</em>, the <em>first</em>
               act drew down the utmost power of punishment; however often repeated, or
               aggravated the crime, human penalty could do no more. The fact that the
               penalty for <em>man</em>-stealing was death, and the penalty for
               <em>property</em>-stealing, the mere restoration of double, shows that the
               two cases were adjudicated on totally different principles. The man stolen
               might be past labor, and his support a burden, yet death was the penalty,
               though not a cent's worth of <em>property value</em> was taken. The
               penalty for stealing property was a mere property penalty. However large the
               theft, the payment of double wiped out the score. It might have a
               greater <em>money</em> value than a thousand men, yet death was not the
               penalty, nor maiming, nor branding, nor even <em>stripes</em>, but double
               of <em>the same kind.</em> Why was not the rule uniform? When a
               <em>man</em> was stolen why was not the thief required to restore double
               of the same kind&#8212;two men, or if he had sold him, five men? Do you say
               that the man-thief might not <em>have</em> them? So the ox-thief might
               not have two oxen, or if he had killed it, five. But if God permitted men to
               hold <em>men</em> as property, equally with <em>oxen</em>, the
               man-thief could get men with whom to pay the penalty, as well as the ox-thief,
               oxen. Further, when <em>property</em> was stolen, the legal penalty was a
               compensation to the person injured. But when a <em>man</em> was stolen,
               no property compensation was offered. To tender money as an equivalent, would
               have been to repeat the outrage with intolerable aggravations. Compute
               the value of a MAN in <em>money!</em> Throw dust into the scale against
               immortality! The law recoiled from such supreme insult and impiety.
               To have permitted the man-thief to expiate his crime by restoring
               double, would have been making the repetition of crime its
               atonement. But the infliction of death for
               <i>man-stealing</i> exacted the utmost possibility of
               reparation. It wrung from the guilty wretch as he gave up the ghost, a
               testimony in blood, and death-groans, to the infinite dignity and worth of
               man,&#8212;a proclamation to the universe,

               voiced in mortal agony, "MAN IS INVIOLABLE"&#8212;a confession shrieked
               in phrenzy at the grave's mouth&#8212;"I die accursed, and God is just."

            </p>
            <p>
               If God permitted man to hold man as property, why did he punish
               for stealing that kind of property infinitely more than for stealing
               any other kind of property? Why did he punish with death for stealing
               a very little of <em>that</em> sort of property, and make a mere fine, the
               penalty for stealing a thousand times as much, of any other sort of
               property&#8212;especially if God did by his own act annihilate the difference
               between man and <em>property,</em> by putting him on a level with it?

            </p>
            <p>
               The atrociousness of a crime, depends much upon the nature, character,
               and condition of the victim. To steal is a crime, whoever the
               thief, or whatever the plunder. To steal bread from a full man, is
               theft; to steal from a starving man, is both theft and murder. If I
               steal my neighbor's property, the crime consists not in altering the
               <em>nature</em> of the article but in shifting its relation from him to
               me. But when I take my neighbor himself, and first make him
               <i>property</i>, and then <em>my</em> property, the
               latter act, which was the sole crime in the former case, dwindles to nothing.
               The sin in stealing a man, is not the transfer from its owner to another of
               that which is <em>already property,</em> but the turning of
               <em>personality</em> into <em>property</em>. True, the attributes of
               man remain, but the rights and immunities which grow out of them
               are attributed. It is the first law both of reason and revelation to
               regard things and beings as they are; and the sum of religion, to
               feel and act towards them according to their value. Knowingly to
               treat them otherwise is sin; and the degree of violence done to their
               nature, religions, and value, measures its guilt. When things are
               sundered which God has indissolubly joined, or confounded in one,
               which he has separated by infinite extremes; when sacred and eternal
               distinctions, which he has garnished with glory, are derided and
               set at nought, then, if ever, sin reddens to its "scarlet dye." The
               sin specified in the passage, is that of doing violence to the
               <i>nature</i> of a man&#8212;to his intrinsic value as a
               rational being, and blotting out the exalted distinction stamped upon him by
               his Maker. In the verse preceding, and in that which follows, the same
               principle is laid down. Verse 15, "He that smiteth his father or his mother
               shall surely be put to death." V. 17, "He that curseth his father or his
               mother, shall surely be put to death." If a Jew smote his neighbor, the law
               merely smote him in return; but if the blow was given to a
               <em>parent,</em> it

               struck the smiter dead. The parental relation is the <em>centre</em> of
               human society. God guards it with peculiar care. To violate that, is
               to violate all. Whoever trampled on that, showed that <em>no</em> relation
               had any sacredness in his eyes&#8212;that he was unfit to move among
               human relations who had violated one so sacred and tender. Therefore,
               the Mosaic law uplifted his bleeding corpse, and brandished the
               ghastly terror around the parental relation to guard it from impious
               inroads.

            </p>
            <p>
               Why such a difference in penalties, for the same act? Answer. (1.)
               The relation violated was obvious&#8212;the distinction between parents
               and others manifest, dictated by natural affection&#8212;a law of the
               constitution. (2.) The act was violence to nature&#8212;a suicide on
               constitutional susceptibilities. (3.) The parental relation then, as now,
               was the focal point of the social system, and required powerful safeguards.
               "<em>Honor thy father and thy mother</em>," stands at the head of
               those commands which prescribe the duties of man to man; and,
               throughout the Bible, the parental state is God's favorite illustration
               of his own relations to the whole human family. In this case death
               was to be inflicted not for smiting a <em>man</em>, but a
               <em>parent</em>&#8212;a <em>distinction</em> cherished by God, and
               around which, He threw up a bulwark of defence. In the next verse, "He that
               stealeth a man," &amp;c., the SAME PRINCIPLE is wrought out in still stronger
               relief. The crime to be punished with death was not the taking of property
               from its owner, but the doing violence to an <em>immortal nature,</em>
               blotting out a sacred <em>distinction</em>, making MEN "chattels." The
               incessant pains taken in the Old Testament to separate human beings from
               brutes and things, shows God's regard for his own distinction.

               "In the beginning" it was uttered in heaven, and proclaimed to
               the universe as it rose into being. Creation was arrayed at the instant
               of its birth, to do it homage. It paused in adoration while God
               ushered forth its crowning work. Why that dread pause and that
               creating arm held back in mid career and that high conference in
               the godhead? "Let us make man in OUR IMAGE after OUR LIKENESS,
               AND LET HIM HAVE DOMINION over the fish of the sea, and over
               the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth." Then
               while every living thing, with land, and sea, and firmament, and marshalled
               worlds, waited to swell the shout of morning stars&#8212;then "GOD
               CREATED MAN IN HIS OWN IMAGE; IN THE IMAGE OF GOD CREATED
               HE HIM." This solves the problem, <b>IN THE IMAGE OF GOD,
                  CREATED HE HIM</b>. Well might the sons of God shout, "Amen,

               alleluia"&#8212;For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,
               and hast crowned him with glory and honor. Thou madest him to
               have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things
               under his feet." Ps. viii. 5, 6. The repetition of this distinction is
               frequent and solemn. In Gen. i. 26-28, it is repeated in various
               forms. In Gen. v. 1, we find it again, "IN THE LIKENESS OF GOD
               MADE HE MAN." In Gen. ix. 6, again. After giving license to shed
               the blood of "every moving thing that liveth," it is added, "<em>Whoso
                  sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed, for</em> IN THE IMAGE
               OF GOD MADE HE MAN." As though it had been said, "All these
               creatures are your property, designed for your use&#8212;they have the
               likeness of earth, they perish with the using, and their spirits go
               downward; but this other being, MAN, has my own likeness: "IN
               THE IMAGE OF GOD made I man;" "an intelligent, moral, immortal
               agent, invited to all that I can give and he can be." So in Lev. xxiv.
               17, 18, 21, "He that killeth any MAN shall surely be put to death;
               and he that killeth a beast shall make it good, beast for beast; and he
               that killeth a man shall be put to death." So in Ps. viii. 5, 6, what
               an enumeration of particulars, each separating infinitely MEN from
               brutes and things! (1.) "<em>Thou hast made him a little lower than the
                  angels.</em>" Slavery drags him down among <em>brutes</em>.
               (2.) "<em>And hast crowned him with glory and honor.</em>" Slavery tears
               off his crown, and puts on a <em>yoke</em>. (3.) "<em>Thou madest him
                  to have dominion</em> OVER <em>the works of thy hands.</em>" Slavery
               breaks the sceptre, and casts him down <i>among</i> those
               works&#8212;yea <em>beneath them</em>. (4.) "<em>Thou hast put
                  all things under his feet.</em>" Slavery puts HIM under the feet of an
               "owner." Who, but an impious scorner, dares thus strive with his
               Maker, and mutilate HIS IMAGE, and blaspheme the Holy One, who
               saith, "<em>Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these, ye did it
                  unto</em> ME."

               In further presenting this inquiry, the Patriarchal and Mosaic systems
               will be considered together, as each reflects light upon the other,
               and as many regulations of the latter are mere <em>legal</em> forms of
               Divine institutions previously existing. As a <em>system</em>, the latter
               alone is of Divine authority. Whatever were the usages of the patriarchs,

               might at small cost greatly augment their numbers. A single stanza
               celebrating patriarchal <i>concubinage</i>, winding off
               with a chorus in honor of patriarchal <i>drunkenness</i>,
               would be a trumpet call, summoning from bush and brake, highway and hedge,
               and sheltering fence, a brotherhood of kindred affinities, each claiming
               Abraham or Noah as his patron saint, and shouting, "My name is legion." What

               Before entering upon an analysis of the condition of servants under
               these two states of society, we will consider the import of certain
               terms which describe the mode of procuring them.

               IMPORT OF "BUY," AND "BOUGHT WITH MONEY."

            </h3>
            <p>
               As the Israelites were commanded to "buy" their servants, and as
               Abraham had servants "bought with money," it is argued that servants
               were articles of <i>property</i>. The sole ground for
               this belief is the terms themselves. How much might be saved, if in
               discussion, the thing to be proved were always <em>assumed</em>.
               To beg the question in debate, would be vast economy of midnight oil! and a
               great forestaller of wrinkles and grey hairs! Instead of protracted
               investigation into Scripture usage, with painful collating of passages, to
               find the meaning of terms, let every man interpret the oldest book in the
               world by the usages of his own time and place, and the work is
               done. And then instead of one revelation, they might be multiplied
               as the drops of the morning, and every man have an infallible clue to
               the mind of the Spirit, if he only understood the dialect of his own
               neighborhood! What a Babel-jargon it would make of the Bible to
               take it for granted that the sense in which words are <em>now</em> used
               is the <i>inspired</i> sense, David says, "I prevented
               the dawning of the morning, and cried." What, stop the earth in its
               revolution! Two hundred years ago, <i>prevent</i> was
               used in its strict Latin sense to <i>come before</i>,
               or <i>anticipate</i>. It is always used in this sense in
               the Old and New Testaments. David's expression, in the English of the
               nineteenth century, would be "Before the dawning of the morning I cried."
               In almost every chapter of the Bible, words are used in a sense now
               nearly or quite obsolete, and sometimes in a sense totally
               <em>opposite</em> to their present meaning. A few examples follow:
               "I purposed to come to you, but was <em>let</em> (hindered) hitherto."
               "And the four <em>beasts</em> (living ones) fell down and worshipped
               God,"&#8212;"Whosoever shall <em>offend</em> (cause to sin) one of these
               little ones,"&#8212;"Go out into the highways and <em>compel</em> (urge)
               them to come in,"&#8212;"Only let your <em>conversation</em> (habitual
               conduct) be as becometh the Gospel,"&#8212;"They that seek me
               <em>early</em> (earnestly) shall find me,"&#8212;"So when tribulation

               or persecution ariseth <em>by-and-by</em> (immediately) they are
               offended." Nothing is more mutable than language. Words, like bodies, are
               always throwing off some particles and absorbing others. So long as
               they are mere <em>representatives</em>, elected by the whims of universal
               suffrage, their meaning will be a perfect volatile, and to cork it up
               for the next century is an employment sufficiently silly (to speak
               within bounds) for a modern Bible Dictionary maker. There never
               was a shallower conceit than that of establishing the sense attached
               to a word centuries ago, by showing what it means <em>now</em>. Pity that
               fashionable mantuamakers were not a little quicker at taking hints
               from some Doctors of Divinity. How easily they might save their
               pious customers all qualms of conscience about the weekly shiftings
               of fashion, by proving that the last importation of Parisian indecency
               now flaunting on promenade, was the very style of dress in which
               the pious Sarah kneaded cakes for the angels, and the modest Rebecca
               drew water for the camels of Abraham's servants. Since such
               fashions are rife in Broadway <em>now</em>, they <em>must</em> have
               been in Canaan and Padanaram four thousand years ago!

            <p>
               The inference that the word buy, used to describe the procuring of
               servants, means procuring them as <i>chattels</i>, seems
               based upon the fallacy, that whatever <em>costs</em> money <em>is</em>
               money; that whatever or whoever you pay money <em>for</em>, is an article
               of property, and the fact of your paying for it <em>proves</em> it
               property. The children of Israel were required to purchase their first-born
               from under the obligations of the priesthood, Num. xviii. 15, 16;
               Ex. xiii. 13; xxxiv. 20. This custom still exists among the Jews, and the
               word <i>buy</i> is still used to describe
               the transaction. Does this prove that their first-born were, or are,
               held as property? They were <i>bought</i> as really as
               were <i>servants</i>. (2.) The Israelites were required
               to pay money for their own souls. This is called sometimes a ransom, sometimes
               an atonement. Were their souls therefore marketable commodities? (3.) Bible
               saints <i>bought</i> their wives. Boaz bought Ruth. "So
               Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I
               <i>purchased</i> to be my wife." Ruth iv. 10.
               Hosea bought his wife. "So I <i>bought</i> her to me for
               fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of
               barley." Hosea iii. 2. Jacob bought his wives Rachael and Leah, and not
               having money, paid for them in labor&#8212;seven years a piece. Gen.
               xxix. 15-29. Moses probably bought his wife in the same way,
               and paid for her by his labor, as the servant of her father. Exod. ii.

               21. Shechem, when negotiating with Jacob and his sons for Dinah,
               says, "Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
               as ye shall say unto me." Gen. xxxiv. 11, 12. David purchased Michal,
               and Othniel, Achsah, by performing perilous services for
               their fathers. 1 Sam. xviii. 25-27; Judg. i. 12, 13. That the
               purchase of wives, either with money or by service, was the general
               practice, is plain from such passages as Ex. xxii. 17, and 1 Sam.
               xviii. 25. Among the modern Jews this usage exists, though now a
               mere form, there being no <em>real</em> purchase. Yet among their marriage
               ceremonies, is one called "marrying by the penny." The coincidences
               in the methods of procuring wives and servants, in the terms
               employed in describing the transactions, and in the prices paid for
               each, are worthy of notice. The highest price of wives (virgins) and
               servants was the same. Comp. Deut. xxii. 28, 29, and Ex. xxii. 17,
               with Lev. xxvii. 2-8. The <em>medium</em> price of wives and servants
               was the same. Comp. Hos. iii. 2, with Ex. xxi. 32. Hosea seems to
               have paid one half in money and the other half in grain. Further,
               the Israelitish female bought servants were <i>wives</i>,
               their husbands and masters being the same persons. Ex. xxi. 8,
               Judg. xix. 3, 27. If <em>buying</em> servants proves them property,
               buying wives proves them property. Why not contend that the <em>wives</em>
               of the ancient fathers of the faithful were their "chattels," and used as
               ready change at a pinch; and thence deduce the rights of modern husbands?
               Alas! Patriarchs and prophets are followed afar off! When will pious husbands
               live up to their Bible privileges, and become partakers with Old Testament
               worthies in the blessedness of a husband's rightful immunities!
               Refusing so to do, is questioning the morality of those "good old patriarchs
               and slaveholders, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."

               This use of the word buy, is not peculiar to the Hebrew. In the
               Syriac, the common expression for "the espoused," is "the bought."
               Even so late as the 16th century, the common record of
               <i>marriages</i> in the old German Chronicles was,
               "A BOUGHT B."

            </p>
            <p>
               The word translated <i>buy</i>, is, like other words,
               modified by the nature of the subject to which it is applied. Eve said, "I
               have <em>gotten</em> (bought) a man of the Lord." She named him Cain,
               that is <em>bought</em>. "He that heareth reproof, getteth (buyeth)
               understanding," Prov. xv. 32. So in Isa. xi. 11. "The Lord shall set his hand
               again to recover (to <em>buy</em>) the remnant of his people."
               So Ps. lxxviii. 54. "He brought them to this mountain which his right hand
               had <em>purchased</em>,"

               (gotten.) Jer. xiii. 4. "Take the girdle that thou hast got" (bought.)
               Neh. v. 8. "We of our ability have <em>redeemed</em> (bought) our brethren
               that were sold to the heathen." Here "<i>bought</i>" is
               not applied to persons reduced to servitude, but to those taken
               <em>out</em> of it. Prov. 8. 22. "The Lord possessed (bought) me in the
               beginning of his way." Prov. xix. 8. "He that
               <i>getteth</i> (buyeth) wisdom loveth his own soul."
               Finally, to <i>buy</i> is a <em>secondary</em> meaning
               of the Hebrew word K&#257;n&#257;.

            </p>
            <p>
               Even at this day the word <i>buy</i> is used to describe
               the procuring of servants, where slavery is abolished. In the British West
               Indies, where slaves became apprentices in 1834, they are still "bought."
               This is the current word in West India newspapers. Ten years
               since servants were "<i>bought</i>" in New-York, as really
               as in Virginia, yet the different senses in which the word was used in the
               two states, put no man in a quandary. Under the system of legal
               <i>indenture</i> in Illinois, servants now are
               "<i>bought.</i>"<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN5"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN5"></a> Until
               recently immigrants to this country were "bought" in great numbers. By
               voluntary contract they engaged to work a given time to pay for their passage.
               This class of persons called "redemptioners," consisted at one time
               of thousands. Multitudes are "bought" <em>out</em> of slavery by
               themselves or others. Under the same roof with the writer is a "servant bought
               with money." A few weeks since, she was a slave; when "bought"
               she was a slave no longer. Alas! for our leading politicians if "buying"
               men makes them "chattels." The Whigs say that Benton and
               Rives are "bought" by the administration; and the other party, that
               Clay and Webster are "bought" by the Bank. The histories of the
               revolution tell us that Benedict Arnold was "bought" by British gold.
               When a northern clergyman marries a rich southern widow, country
               gossip thus hits off the indecency, "The cotton bags <em>bought</em> him."
               Sir Robert Walpole said, "Every man has his price, and whoever will
               pay it, can <em>buy</em> him," and John Randolph said, "The northern
               delegation is in the market, give me money enough, and I can <em>buy</em>
               them;" both meant just what they said. The temperance publications tell us
               that candidates for office <em>buy</em> men with whiskey; and the oracles
               of street tattle that the court, district attorney, and jury, in the

               late trial of Robinson were <em>bought</em>, yet we have no floating
               visions of "chattels personal," man auctions, or coffles.

               The transaction between Joseph and the Egyptians gives a clue to
               the use of "buy" and "bought with money." Gen, xlvii. 18-26.
               The Egyptians proposed to Joseph to become servants. When the
               bargain was closed, Joseph said, "Behold I have <em>bought you</em> this
               day," and yet it is plain that neither party regarded the persons
               <em>bought</em> as articles of property, but merely as bound to labor on
               certain conditions, to pay for their support during the famine. The idea
               attached by both parties to "buy us," and "behold I have bought
               you," was merely that of service voluntarily offered, and secured by
               contract, in return for <em>value received</em>, and not at all that the
               Egyptians were bereft of their personal ownership, and made articles of
               property. And this buying of <em>services</em> (in this case it was but
               one-fifth part) is called in Scripture usage, <i>buying the
                  persons</i>. This case claims special notice, as it is the only one where
               the whole transaction of buying servants is detailed&#8212;the preliminaries,
               the process, the mutual acquiescence, and the permanent relation resulting
               therefrom. In all other instances, the <em>mere fact</em> is stated
               without particulars. In this case, the whole process is laid open. (1.) The
               persons "bought," <em>sold themselves</em>, and of their own accord.
               (2.) Obtaining permanently the <em>services</em> of persons, or even a
               portion of them, is called "buying" those persons. The objector, at the
               outset, takes it for granted, that servants were bought of <em>third</em>
               persons; and thence infers that they were articles of property. Both the
               alleged fact and the inference are sheer <em>assumptions</em>. No instance
               is recorded, under the Mosaic system, in which a <em>master sold his
                  servant</em>. That servants who were "bought" <em>sold themselves</em>
               is a fair inference from various passages of Scripture.

               In Leviticus xxv. 47, the case of the Israelite, who became the
               servant of the stranger, the words are, "If he SELL HIMSELF unto
               the stranger." The <em>same word</em>, and the same <em>form</em> of
               the word, which, in verse 47, is rendered <i>sell
                  himself</i>, is in verse 39 of the same chapter, rendered
               <i>be sold</i>; in Deut. xxviii. 68, the same word is
               rendered "be sold." "And there ye shall BE SOLD unto your enemies
               for bond-men and bond-women and NO MAN SHALL BUY YOU."
               How could they "<em>be sold</em>" without <em>being bought</em>? Our
               translation makes it nonsense. The word
               M&#257;kar rendered "be sold" is used
               here in the Hithpael conjugation, which is generally reflexive in its
               force, and, like the middle voice in Greek, represents what an individual

               does for himself, and should manifestly have been rendered,
               "ye shall <i>offer yourselves</i> for sale, and there
               shall be no purchaser." For a clue to Scripture usage on this point, see
               1 Kings xxi. 20, 25&#8212;"Thou hast <i>sold thyself</i>
               to work evil." "There was none like to Ahab that
               <i>sold himself</i> to work wickedness."&#8212;2 Kings
               xvii. 17. "They used divination and enchantments, and
               <i>sold themselves</i> to do evil."&#8212;Isa. l. 1. "For
               your iniquities have ye <i>sold yourselves</i>."
               Isa. lii. 3, "Ye have <i>sold yourselves</i> FOR NOUGHT,
               and ye shall be redeemed without money." See also, Jer. xxxiv. 14&#8212;Romans
               vii. 14, vi. 16&#8212;John viii. 34, and the case of Joseph and the Egyptians,
               already quoted. In the purchase of wives, though spoken of rarely,
               it is generally stated that they were bought of <em>third</em> persons.
               If <i>servants</i> were bought of third persons, it is
               strange that no <em>instance</em> of it is on record.

               II.&#8212;THE LEADING DESIGN OF THE LAWS RELATING TO
               SERVANTS, WITH THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES SECURED TO THEM.

            </p>
            <p>
               The general object of the laws defining the relations of master
               and servant, was the good of both parties&#8212;more especially the good
               of the <em>servants</em>. While the master's interests were guarded from
               injury, those of the servants were <em>promoted</em>. These laws made a
               merciful provision for the poorer classes, both of the Israelites and
               Strangers, not laying on burdens, but lightening them&#8212;they were a grant
               of <em>privileges</em> and <em>favors</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               I. No servant from the Strangers, could remain in the family of
               an Israelite without becoming a proselyte. Compliance with this
               condition was the <em>price of the privilege</em>.&#8212;Gen. xvii. 9-14,
               23, 27.

            </p>
            <p>
               II. Excommunication from the family was a PUNISHMENT.&#8212;Gen.
               xxi. 14. Luke xvi. 2-4.

            </p>
            <p>
               III. Every Hebrew servant could COMPEL his master to keep him
               after the six years contract had expired. This shows that the system
               was framed to advance the interests and gratify the wishes of the
               servant quite as much as those of the master. If the servant
               <em>demanded</em> it, the law <em>obliged</em> the master to retain
               him, however little he might need his services. Deut. xv. 12-17. Ex. xxi. 2-6.

            </p>
            <p>
               IV. The rights and privileges guarantied by law to all servants.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. <em>They were admitted into covenant with God.</em> Deut. xxix.
               10-13.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. <em>They were invited guests at all the national and family
                  festivals.</em> Ex. xii. 43-44; Deut. xii. 12, 18, xvi. 10-16.

            </p>
            <p>
               3. <em>They were statedly instructed in morality and religion.</em>
               Deut. xxxi. 10-13; Josh. viii. 33-35; 2 Chron. xvii. 8-9.

            </p>
            <p>
               4. <em>They were released from their regular labor nearly</em> ONE HALF
               OF THE WHOLE TIME. During which they had their entire support,
               and the same instruction that was provided for the other members of
               the Hebrew community.

            </p>
            <p>
               (a.) The Law secured to them the <em>whole of every seventh year;</em>
               Lev. xxv. 3-6; thus giving to those who were servants during the
               entire period between the jubilees, <em>eight whole years,</em> including
               the jubilee year, of unbroken rest.

            </p>
            <p>
               (b.) <em>Every seventh day.</em> This in forty-two years, the eight being
               subtracted from the fifty, would amount to just <em>six years.</em></p>
            <p>
               (c.) <em>The three annual festivals.</em> The <em>Passover</em>,
               which commenced on the 15th of the 1st month, and lasted seven days,
               Deut. xvi. 3, 8. The Pentecost, or Feast of Weeks, which began on the 6th day
               of the 3d month, and lasted seven days. Lev. xvi. 10, 11. The
               Feast of Tabernacles, which commenced on the 15th of the 7th
               month, and lasted eight days. Deut. xvi. 13, 15; Lev. xxiii. 34-39.
               As all met in one place, much time would be spent on the journey.
               Cumbered caravans move slowly. After their arrival, a day or two
               would be requisite for divers preparations before the celebration, besides
               some time at the close of it, in preparations for return. If we
               assign three weeks to each festival&#8212;including the time spent on the
               journeys, and the delays before and after the celebration, together
               with the <em>festival week</em>, it will be a small allowance for the
               cessation of their regular labor. As there were three festivals in the year,
               the main body of the servants would be absent from their stated employments
               at least <em>nine weeks annually</em>, which would amount in forty-two
               years, subtracting the Sabbaths, to six years and eighty-four days.

            </p>
            <p>
               (d.) <em>The new moons.</em> The Jewish year had twelve; Josephus
               says that the Jews always kept <em>two</em> days for the new moon. See
               Calmet on the Jewish Calendar, and Horne's Introduction; also 1
               Sam. xx. 18, 19, 27. This in forty-two years, would be two years
               280 days.

            </p>
            <p>
               (e.) <em>The feast of trumpets</em>. On the first day of the seventh
               month, and of the civil year. Lev. xxiii. 24, 25.

            </p>
            <p>
               (f.) <em>The atonement day</em>. On the tenth of the seventh month.
               Lev. xxiii. 27.

            </p>
            <p>
               These two feasts would consume not less than sixty-five days not
               reckoned above.

            </p>
            <p>
               Thus it appears that those who continued servants during the period between
               the jubilees, were by law released from their labor, TWENTY-THREE YEARS AND
               SIXTY-FOUR DAYS, OUT OF FIFTY YEARS,
               and those who remained a less time, in nearly the same proportion.
               In this calculation, besides making a donation of all the
               <em>fractions</em> to the objector, we have left out those numerous
               <em>local</em> festivals to which frequent allusion is made, Judg. xxi.
               19; I Sam. ix. etc., and the various <em>family</em> festivals, such as at
               the weaning of children; at marriages; at sheep shearings; at circumcisions;
               at the making of covenants, &amp;c., to which reference is often made, as in
               1 Sam. xx. 28, 29. Neither have we included the festivals instituted at a
               later period of the Jewish history. The feast of Purim, Esth. ix. 28, 29; and
               of the Dedication, which lasted eight days. John x. 22; 1 Mac.
               iv. 59.

            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, the Mosaic system secured to servants, an amount of time
               which, if distributed, would be almost ONE HALF OF THE DAYS IN
               EACH YEAR. Meanwhile, they were supported, and furnished with
               opportunities of instruction. If this time were distributed over
               <em>every day</em>, the servants would have to themselves nearly
               <em>one half of each day</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               THIS IS A REGULATION OF THAT MOSAIC SYSTEM WHICH IS
               CLAIMED BY SLAVEHOLDERS AS THE PROTOTYPE OF AMERICAN
               SLAVERY.

            </p>
            <p>
               V. The servant was protected by law equally with the other members of the
               community.

            </p>
            <p>
               Proof.&#8212;"Judge righteously between every man and his neighbor,
               and THE STRANGER THAT IS WITH HIM." "Ye shall not RESPECT
               PERSONS in judgement, but ye shall hear the SMALL as well as
               the great." Deut. i. 16, 17. Also Lev. xxiv. 22. "Ye shall have
               one manner of law as well for the STRANGER, as for one of your own
               country." So Numb. xv. 29. "Ye shall have ONE LAW for him that
               sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children

               of Israel and for the STRANGER that sojourneth among them."
               Deut. xxvii. 19. "Cursed be he that PERVERTETH THE JUDGMENT
               OF THE STRANGER."

            </p>
            <p>
               VI. The Mosaic system enjoined the greatest affection and kindness
               toward servants, foreign as well as Jewish.

            </p>
            <p>
               Lev. xix. 34. "The stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto
               you as one born among you, and thou shall love him as thyself." Also
               Deut. x. 17, 19. "For the Lord your God * * REGARDETH NOT
               PERSONS. He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and
               LOVETH THE STRANGER, in giving him food and raiment,
               LOVE YE THEREFORE THE STRANGER." So Ex. xxii. 21. "Thou
               shalt neither vex a STRANGER nor oppress him." Ex. xxiii. 9. "Thou
               shalt not oppress a STRANGER, for ye know the heart of a stranger."
               Lev. xxv. 35, 36. "If thy brother be waxen poor thou shalt relieve
               him, yea, though he be a STRANGER or a sojourner, that he may live
               with thee, take thou no usury of him or increase, but fear thy God."
               Could this same stranger be taken by one that feared his God, and
               held as a slave, and robbed of time, earnings, and all his rights?

            </p>
            <p>
               VII. Servants were placed upon a level with their masters in all
               civil and religious rights. Num. xv. 15, 16, 29; ix. 14. Deut. i.
               16, 17. Lev. xxiv. 22.

               III.&#8212;DID PERSONS BECOME SERVANTS VOLUNTARILY,
               OR WERE THEY MADE SERVANTS AGAINST THEIR WILLS?

            </p>
            <p>
               We argue that they became servants <em>of their own accord</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               I. Because to become a servant in the family of an Israelite, was
               to abjure idolatry, to enter into covenant with
               God<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN6"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN6"></a>, be circumcised in

               token of it, bound to keep the Sabbath, the Passover, the Pentecost,
               and the Feast of Tabernacles, and to receive instruction in the
               moral and ceremonial law. Were the servants <em>forced</em> through all
               these processes? Was the renunciation of idolatry <em>compulsory</em>?
               Were they <em>dragged</em> into covenant with God? Were they seized and
               circumcised by <em>main strength</em>? Were they <em>compelled</em>
               mechanically to chew, and swallow the flesh of the Paschal lamb, while they
               abhorred the institution, spurned the laws that enjoined it, detested its
               author and its executors, and instead of rejoicing in the deliverance
               which it commemorated, bewailed it as a calamity, and cursed the
               day of its consummation? Were they <em>driven</em> from all parts of the
               land three times in the year to the annual festivals? Were they
               drugged with instruction which they nauseated? Goaded through a
               round of ceremonies, to them senseless and disgusting mummeries;
               and drilled into the tactics of a creed rank with loathed abominations?
               We repeat it, to became a <i>servant</i>, was to become
               a <i>proselyte</i>. And
               did God authorize his people to make proselytes, at the point of the
               sword? by the terror of pains and penalties? by converting men into
               <em>merchandise</em>? Were <i>proselyte and
                  chattel</i> synonymes, in the Divine vocabulary? Must a man be sunk to a
               <em>thing</em> before taken into covenant with God? Was this the
               stipulated condition of adoption, and the sole passport to the communion of
               the saints?

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r3_FN6"></a><a href="#FootE4r3_FN6">A</a>: Maimonides, who wrote in Egypt about seven
               hundred years ago, a contemporary with Jarchi, and who stands with him at the
               head of Jewish writers, gives the following testimony on this point:

            </p>
            <p>
               "Whether a servant be born in the power of an Israelite, or whether he be
               purchased from the heathen, the master is to bring them both into the
               covenant."

            </p>
            <p>
               "But he that is in the <em>house</em> is entered on the eighth day, and he
               that is bought with money, on the day on which his master receives him, unless
               the slave be <em>unwilling</em>. For if the master receive a grown slave,
               and he be <em>unwilling</em>, his master is to bear with him, to seek to
               win him over by instruction, and by love and kindness, for one year. After
               which, should he <em>refuse</em> so long, it is forbidden to keep him
               longer than a year. And the master must send him back to the strangers from
               whence he came. For the God of Jacob will not accept any other than the
               worship of a willing heart"&#8212;Mamon, Hilcoth Mileth, Chap. 1st, Sec. 8th.

            </p>
            <p>
               The ancient Jewish Doctors assert that the servant from the Strangers who at
               the close of his probationary year, refused to adopt the Jewish religion and
               was on that account sent back to his own people, received a <em>full
                  compensation</em> for his services, besides the payment of his expenses. But
               that <em>postponement</em> of the circumcision of the foreign servant
               for a year (<em>or even at all</em> after he had
               entered the family of an Israelite), of which the Mishnic doctors
               speak, seems to have been <em>a mere usage</em>. We
               find nothing of it in the regulations of the Mosaic system. Circumcision was
               manifestly a rite strictly <em>initiatory</em>. Whether it was a rite
               merely <em>national</em> or <em>spiritual</em>,
               or <em>both</em>, comes not within the scope of
               this inquiry.
            </p>
            <p><a name="E4r3_vol_run"></a>
               II. We argue the voluntariness of servants from Deut. xxiii. 15,
               16, "Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is
               escaped from his master unto thee. He shall dwell with thee, even
               among you, in that place which he shall choose, in one of thy gates
               where it liketh him best; thou shalt not oppress him."

            </p>
            <p>
               As though God had said, "To deliver him up would be to recognize

               the <em>right</em> of the master to hold him; his <em>fleeing</em>
               shows his <em>choice</em>&#8212;proclaims
               his wrongs and his title to protection; you shall not
               force him back and thus recognize the <em>right</em> of the master to hold
               him in such a condition as induces him to flee to others for protection."
               It may be said that this command referred only to the servants
               of <em>heathen</em> masters in the surrounding nations. We answer, the
               terms of the command are unlimited. But the objection, if valid, would
               merely shift the pressure of the difficulty to another point. Did God
               require them to protect the <i>free choice</i> of a
               <em>single</em> servant from the heathen, and yet <em>authorize</em>
               the same persons, to crush the free choice of <em>thousands</em> of
               servants from the heathen? Suppose a case. A <em>foreign</em> servant
               flees to the Israelites; God says, "He shall dwell with thee, in that place
               which <em>he shall choose</em>, in one of thy gates where it
               <em>liketh him</em> best." Now, suppose this same servant, instead
               of coming into Israel of his own accord, had been <em>dragged</em> in by
               some kidnapper who <em>bought</em> him of his master, and
               <em>forced</em> him into a condition against his will; would He who
               forbade such treatment of the stranger, who <em>voluntarily</em> came
               into the land, sanction the <em>same</em> treatment of the <em>same
                  person</em>, provided in <em>addition</em> to this last outrage,
               the <em>previous</em> one had been committed of forcing him into the
               nation against his will? To commit violence on the free choice of a
               <em>foreign</em> servant is forsooth a horrible enormity, PROVIDED you
               <em>begin</em> the violence <em>after</em> he has come among you. But
               if you commit the <em>first act</em> on the <i>other side
                  of the line</i>; if you begin the outrage by buying him from a third person
               against his will, and then tear him from home, drag him across the line into
               the land of Israel, and hold him as a slave&#8212;ah! that alters the case,
               and you may perpetrate the violence now with impunity! Would
               <em>greater</em> favor have been shown to this new comer than to the old
               residents&#8212;those who had been servants in Jewish families perhaps for a
               generation? Were the Israelites commanded to exercise toward <em>him</em>,
               uncircumcised and out of the covenant, a justice and kindness denied to the
               multitudes who <em>were</em> circumcised, and <em>within</em> the
               covenant? But, the objector finds small gain to his argument on the
               supposition that the covenant respected merely the fugitives from the
               surrounding nations, while it left the servants of the Israelites in a
               condition against their wills. In that case, the surrounding nations would
               adopt retaliatory measures, and become so many asylums for Jewish fugitives.
               As these nations were not only on every side of them, but in their midst, such

               a proclamation would have been an effectual lure to men whose condition
               was a constant counteraction of will. Besides the same command
               which protected the servant from the power of his foreign <em>master</em>,
               protected him equally from the power of an <em>Israelite</em>. It was not,
               "Thou shalt not deliver him unto his <em>master</em>," but "he shall dwell
               with thee, in that place which <em>he shall choose</em> in one of thy
               gates where it liketh <em>him</em> best." Every Israelite was forbidden to
               put him in any condition <em>against his will</em>. What was this but a
               proclamation, that all who <em>chose</em> to live in the land and obey
               the laws, were left to their own free will, to dispose of their services at
               such a rate, to such persons and in such places as they pleased? Besides,
               grant that this command prohibited the sending back of <em>foreign</em>
               servants merely, there was no law requiring the return of servants who had
               escaped from the <em>Israelites</em>. <em>Property</em> lost, and
               <em>cattle</em> escaped, they were required to return, but not escaped
               servants. These verses contain 1st, a command, "Thou shall not deliver,"
               &amp;c., 2d, a declaration of the fugitive's right of <em>free
                  choice</em>, and of God's will that he should exercise it at his own
               discretion; and 3d, a command guarding this right, namely, "Thou shalt not
               oppress him," as though God had said, "If you restrain him from exercising
               his <em>own choice</em>, as to the place and condition of his residence,
               it is <i>oppression</i>."

            </p>
            <p>
               III. We argue the voluntariness of servants from their peculiar
               opportunities and facilities for escape. Three times every year, all
               the males over twelve years, were required to attend the national
               feasts. They were thus absent from their homes not less than three
               weeks at each time, making nine weeks annually. As these caravans
               moved over the country, were there military scouts lining the
               way, to intercept deserters?&#8212;a corporal's guard at each pass of the
               mountains, sentinels pacing the hill-tops, and light horse scouring
               the defiles? The Israelites must have had some safe contrivance
               for taking their "<em>slaves</em>" three times in a year to Jerusalem
               and back. When a body of slaves is moved any distance in our
               <em>republic</em>, they are hand-cuffed and chained together, to keep them
               from running away, or beating their drivers' brains out. Was this the
               <em>Mosaic</em> plan, or an improvement introduced by Samuel, or was it
               left for the wisdom of Solomon? The usage, doubtless, claims a paternity not
               less venerable and biblical! Perhaps they were lashed upon camels, and
               transported in bundles, or caged up, and trundled on wheels to and
               fro, and while at the Holy City, "lodged in jail for safe keeping,"

               the Sanhedrim appointing special religious services for their benefit,
               and their "drivers" officiating at "ORAL instruction." Mean while, what
               became of the sturdy <i>handmaids</i> left at home? What
               hindered them from marching off in a body? Perhaps the Israelitish matrons
               stood sentry in rotation round the kitchens, while the young ladies scoured
               the country, as mounted rangers, picking up stragglers by day, and patrolled
               the streets, keeping a sharp look-out at night.

               IV. Their continuance in Jewish families depended upon the performance of
               various rites necessarily VOLUNTARY.

            </p>
            <p>
               Suppose the servants from the heathen had upon entering Jewish
               families, refused circumcision; if <em>slaves</em>, how simple the process
               of emancipation! Their <em>refusal</em> did the job. Or, suppose they had
               refused to attend the annual feasts, or had eaten unleavened bread
               during the Passover, or compounded the ingredients of the anointing
               oil, they would have been "cut off from the people;"
               <i>excommunicated</i>.

            </p>
            <p>
               V. We infer the voluntariness of the servants of the Patriarchs
               from the impossibility of their having been held against their wills.
               Abraham's servants are an illustration. At one time he had three
               hundred and eighteen <i>young men</i> "born in his house,"
               and many more <em>not</em> born in his house. His servants of all ages,
               were probably MANY THOUSANDS. How Abraham and Sarah contrived to hold fast
               so many thousand servants against their wills, we are left quite in
               the dark. The most natural supposition is that the Patriarch and his
               wife <em>took turns</em> in surrounding them! The neighboring tribes,
               instead of constituting a picket guard to hem in his servants, would have
               been far more likely to sweep them and him into captivity, as they
               did Lot and his household. Besides, there was neither "Constitution" nor
               "compact," to send back Abraham's fugitives, nor a truckling police to pounce
               upon them, nor gentleman-kidnappers, suing for his patronage, volunteering
               to howl on their track, boasting their blood-hound scent, and pledging their
               "honor" to hunt down and "deliver up," <em>provided</em> they had a
               description of the "flesh-marks," and were suitably stimulated by
               <em>pieces of silver</em>. Abraham seems also to have been sadly deficient
               in all the auxiliaries of family government, such as stocks, hand-cuffs,
               foot-chains, yokes, gags, and thumb-screws. His destitution of these
               patriarchal indispensables is the more afflicting, since he faithfully trained
               "his household to do justice and judgment," though so deplorably destitute of
               the needful aids.

            </p>
            <p>
               VI. We infer that servants were voluntary, as there is no instance
               of an Israelitish master SELLING a servant. Abraham had thousands
               of servants, but seems never to have sold one. Isaac "grew until he
               became very great," and had "great store of servants." Jacob's
               youth was spent in the family of Laban, where he lived a servant
               twenty-one years. Afterward he had a large number of servants.
               Joseph sent for Jacob to come into Egypt, "thou and thy children,
               and thy children's children, and thy flocks and thy herds, and ALL
               THAT THOU HAST." Jacob took his flocks and herds but <em>no servants</em>.
               Gen xlv. 10; xlvii. 16. They doubtless, served under their <em>own
                  contracts</em>, and when Jacob went into Egypt, they <em>chose</em> to
               stay in their own country. The government might sell <em>thieves</em>, if
               they had no property, until their services had made good the injury, and paid
               the legal fine. Ex. xxii. 3. But <em>masters</em> seem to have had no
               power to sell their <em>servants</em>. To give the master a
               <em>right</em> to sell his servant, would annihilate the servant's right
               of choice in his own disposal; but says the objector, "to give the master a
               right to <em>buy</em> a servant, equally annihilates the servant's
               <em>right of choice</em>." Answer. It is one thing to have a right to buy
               a man, and a different thing to have a right to buy him of
               <em>another</em> man<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN7"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN7"></a>.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r3_FN7"></a><a href="#FootE4r3_FN7">A</a>: There is no evidence that
               masters had the power to dispose even the <i>services</i>
               of their servants, as men hire out their laborers whom they employ by the
               year; but whether they had or not, affects not the argument.
            </p>
            <p>
               Though servants were not bought of their masters, yet young females
               were bought of their <em>fathers</em>. But their purchase as
               <em>servants</em> was their betrothal as wives. Ex. xxi. 7, 8. "If a man
               sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the
               men-servants do. If she please not her master WHO HATH BETROTHED
               HER TO HIMSELF, he shall let her be
               redeemed."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN8"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN8"></a></p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r3_FN8"></a><a href="#FootE4r3_FN8">B</a>: The comment of Maimonides on this passage
               is as follows: "A Hebrew handmaid might not be sold but to one who laid
               himself under obligations, to espouse her to himself or to his son, when she
               was fit to be
               betrothed."&#8212;<em>Maimonides&#8212;Hilcoth&#8212;Obedim</em>,
               Ch. IV. Sec. XI. Jarchi, on the same passage, says, "He is bound to espouse
               her and take her to be his wife, for the <em>money of her purchase</em>
               is the money of her espousal."
            </p>
            <p>
               VII. We infer that the Hebrew servant was voluntary in COMMENCING
               his service, because he was pre-eminently so IN CONTINUING it.
               If, at the year of release, it was the servant's <em>choice</em> to remain
               with his master, law required his ear to be bored by the judges of the
               land, thus making it impossible for him to be held against his will.

               Yea more, his master was <em>compelled</em> to keep him, however much he
               might wish to get rid of him.

            </p>
            <p>
               VIII. The method prescribed for procuring servants, was an appeal
               to their choice. The Israelites were commanded to offer them
               a suitable inducement, and then leave them to decide. They might
               neither seize them by <em>force</em>, nor frighten them by
               <em>threats</em>, nor wheedle them by false pretences, nor
               <em>borrow</em> them, nor <em>beg</em> them; but they
               were commanded to buy them<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN9"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN9"></a>; that is, they
               were to recognize the <em>right</em> of the individuals to
               <em>dispose</em> of their own services, and their right to
               <em>refuse all offers</em>, and thus oblige those who made them,
               <em>to do their own work</em>. Suppose all, with one accord, had
               <em>refused</em> to become servants, what provision did the Mosaic law
               make for such an emergency? NONE.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r3_FN9"></a><a href="#FootE4r3_FN9">A</a>: The case of thieves, whose
               services were sold until they had earned enough to make restitution to the
               person wronged, and to pay the legal penalty, <em>stands by itself,</em>
               and has nothing to do with the condition of servants.
            </p>
            <p>
               IX. Various incidental expressions corroborate the idea that servants
               became such by their own contract. Job xli. 4, is an illustration,
               "Will he (Leviathan) make a COVENANT with thee? wilt thou
               take him for a SERVANT forever?"

            </p>
            <p>
               X. The transaction which made the Egyptians the SERVANTS OF
               PHARAOH was voluntary throughout. See Gen. xlvii. 18-26. Of
               their own accord they came to Joseph and said, "We have not aught
               left but our <em>bodies</em> and our lands; <em>buy us</em>;" then in
               the 25th verse, "we will be servants to Pharaoh."

            </p>
            <p>
               XI. We infer the voluntariness of servants, from the fact that RICH
               Strangers did not become servants. Indeed, so far were they from
               becoming servants themselves, that they bought and held Jewish servants.
               Lev. xxv. 47.

            </p>
            <p>
               XII. The sacrifices and offerings which ALL were required to
               present, were to be made VOLUNTARILY. Lev. i. 2, 3.

            </p>
            <p>
               XIII. Mention is often made of persons becoming servants where
               they were manifestly and pre-eminently VOLUNTARY. As the Prophet
               Elisha. 1 Kings xix. 21; 2 Kings iii. 11. Elijah was his
               <em>master</em>. The word, translated master, is the same that is so
               rendered in almost every instance where masters are spoken of under the Mosaic
               and patriarchal systems. Moses was the servant of Jethro.
               Ex. iii. 1. Joshua was the servant of Moses. Num. xi. 28. Jacob
               was the servant of Laban. Gen. xxix. 18-27.

               IV.&#8212;WERE THE SERVANTS FORCED TO WORK WITHOUT PAY?

            </p>
            <p>
               As the servants became and continued such of <em>their own accord</em>,
               it would be no small marvel if they <em>chose</em> to work without pay.
               Their becoming servants, pre-supposes <em>compensation</em> as a motive.
               That they <em>were paid</em> for their labor, we argue,

            </p>
            <p>
               I. Because God rebuked in thunder, the sin of using the labor of
               others without wages. "Wo unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness,
               and his chambers by wrong; THAT USETH HIS NEIGHBOR'S
               SERVICE WITHOUT WAGES, and giveth him not for his work."
               Jer. xxii. 13. God here testifies that to use the service of others
               without wages is "unrighteousness" and pronounces his "wo"
               against the doer of the "wrong." The Hebrew word
               <i>Re&#257;</i>, translated
               <i>neighbor</i>, does not mean one man, or class of men,
               in distinction from others, but any one with whom we have to do&#8212;all
               descriptions of persons, even those who prosecute us in lawsuits and enemies
               while in the act of fighting us&#8212;"As when a man riseth against his
               NEIGHBOR and slayeth him." Deut. xxii. 26. "Go not forth hastily to
               strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy
               NEIGHBOR hath put thee to shame." Prov. xxv. 8. "Thou shalt not
               bear false witness against thy NEIGHBOR." Ex. xx. 16. "If any man
               come presumptuously upon his NEIGHBOR to slay him with guile."
               Ex. xxi. 14, &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               II. God testifies that in our duty to our fellow men, ALL THE LAW
               AND THE PROPHETS hang upon this command, "Thou shalt love thy
               neighbor as thyself." Our Savior, in giving this command, quoted
               <i>verbatim</i> one of the laws of the
               Mosaic system. Lev. xix. 18. In the 34th verse of the same chapter, Moses
               applies this law to the treatment of Strangers, "The stranger that dwelleth
               with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and THOU SHALT LOVE HIM AS
               THYSELF." If it be loving others <em>as</em> ourselves, to make them work
               for us without pay; to rob them of food and clothing also, would be
               a stronger illustration still of the law of love!
               <em>Super</em>-disinterested benevolence! And if it be doing unto others
               as we would have them do to us, to make them work for <em>our own</em>
               good alone, Paul should be called to order for his hard saying against human
               nature, especially for that libellous matter in Eph. v. 29, "No man ever yet
               hated his own flesh, but nourisheth it and cherisheth it."

            </p>
            <p>
               III. As persons became servants FROM POVERTY, we argue that
               they were compensated, since they frequently owned property, and
               sometimes a large amount. Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, gave
               David a princely present, "An hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred
               bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle
               of wine." 2 Sam. xvi. 1. The extent of his possessions can
               be inferred from the fact, that though the father of fifteen sons, he
               had twenty servants. In Lev. xxv. 57-59, where a servant, reduced
               to poverty, sold himself, it is declared that he may be
               <i>redeemed</i>, either
               by his kindred, or by HIMSELF. Having been forced to sell himself
               from poverty, he must have acquired considerable property <em>after</em>
               he became a servant. If it had not been common for servants to acquire
               property over which they had the control, the servant of Elisha
               would hardly have ventured to take a large sum of money, (nearly
               $3000<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN10"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN10"></a>) from Naaman, 2 Kings v. 22, 23. As it was
               procured by deceit, he wished to conceal the means used in getting it; but if
               servants, could "own nothing, nor acquire any thing," to embark in such
               an enterprise would have been consummate stupidity. The fact of
               having in his possession two talents of silver, would of itself convict
               him of theft<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN11"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN11"></a>.
               But since it was common for servants to own

               property he might have it, and invest or use it, without attracting
               special attention, and that consideration alone would have been a
               strong motive to the act. His master, while rebuking him for using
               such means to get the money, not only does not take it from him; but
               seems to expect that he would invest it in real estate, and cattle, and would
               procure servants with it. 2 Kings v. 26. We find the servant of Saul having
               money, and relieving his master in an emergency. 1 Sam. ix. 8. Arza, the
               servant of Elah, was the <em>owner of a house</em>.
               That it was somewhat magnificent, would be a natural inference from it's being
               a resort of the king. 1 Kings xvi. 9. The case of the Gibeonites,
               who after becoming servants, still occupied their cities, and
               remained in many respects, a distinct people for centuries; and that
               of the 150,000 Canaanites, the <em>servants</em> of Solomon, who worked
               out their "tribute of bond-service" in levies, periodically relieving each
               other, are additional illustrations of independence in the acquisition and
               ownership of property.

            <p><a name="NoteE4r3_FN10"></a><a href="#FootE4r3_FN10">A</a>: Though we have not sufficient data to decide
               upon the <em>relative</em> value of that sum, <em>then</em> and
               <em>now</em>, yet we have enough to warrant us in saying that two talents
               of silver, had far more value <em>then</em> than three thousand dollars
               have <em>now</em>.

            <p><a name="NoteE4r3_FN11"></a><a href="#FootE4r3_FN11">B</a>: Whoever heard of the slaves in our
               southern states stealing a large amount of money? They "<em>know how to
                  take care of themselves</em>" quite too well for that. When
               they steal, they are careful to do it on such a <em>small</em> scale, or
               in the taking of <em>such things</em> as will make detection difficult.
               No doubt they steal now and then a little, and a gaping marvel would it be if
               they did not. Why should they not follow in the footsteps of their masters and
               mistresses? Dull scholars indeed! if, after so many lessons from
               <em>proficients</em> in the art, who drive the business by
               <i>wholesale</i>, they should not occasionally copy their
               betters, fall into the <em>fashion</em>, and try their hand in a small
               way, at a practice which is the <em>only permanent and universal</em>
               business carried on around them! Ignoble truly! never to feel the stirrings
               of high impulse, prompting to imitate the eminent pattern set before them in
               the daily vocation of "Honorables" and "Excellences," and to emulate the
               illustrious examples of Doctors of Divinity, and <em>Right</em>
               and <em>Very Reverends</em>! Hear President Jefferson's testimony. In
               his Notes on Virginia, pp. 207-8, speaking of slaves, he says, "That
               disposition to theft with which they have been branded, must be ascribed to
               their <em>situation</em>, and not to any special depravity of the moral
               sense. It is a problem which I give the master to solve, whether the religious
               precepts against the violation of property were not framed for
               HIM as well as for his slave&#8212;and whether the slave may not as
               justifiably take a <i>little</i> from one who has taken
               ALL from him, as he may <em>slay</em> one who would slay him?"
            </p>
            <p>
               IV. Heirship.&#8212;Servants frequently inherited their master's property;
               especially if he had no sons, or if they had dishonored the
               family. Eliezer, the servant of Abraham; Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth,
               Jarha the servant of Sheshan, and the <i>husbandmen</i>
               who said of their master's son, "this is the HEIR, let us kill him, and the
               INHERITANCE WILL BE OURS," are illustrations; also Prov. xvii. 2&#8212;"A
               wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and
               SHALL HAVE PART OF THE INHERITANCE AMONG THE BRETHREN."
               This passage gives servants precedence as heirs, even over the wives and
               daughters of their masters. Did masters hold by force, and
               plunder of earnings, a class of persons, from which, in frequent contingencies,
               they selected both heirs for their property, and husbands
               for their daughters?

            </p>

               V. ALL were required to present offerings and sacrifices. Deut.
               xvi. 15, 17, 2 Chron. xv. 9-11. Numb. ix. 13. Servants must have
               had permanently, the means of <em>acquiring</em> property to meet these
               expenditures.

            </p>
            <p>
               VI. Those Hebrew servants who went out at the seventh year,
               were provided by law with a large stock of provisions and cattle.
               Deut. xv. 11-14. "Thou shall furnish him liberally out of thy
               flock, and out of thy flour, and out of thy wine press, of that wherewith
               the Lord thy God hath blessed thee, thou shall give
               him<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN12"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN12"></a>." If

               it be said that the servants from the Strangers did not receive a like
               bountiful supply, we answer, neither did the most honorable class of
               <em>Israelitish</em> servants, the free-holders; and for the same reason,
               <em>they did not go out in the seventh year</em>, but continued until the
               jubilee. If the fact that the Gentile servants did not receive such a
               <i>gratuity</i> proves that they were robbed of their
               <em>earnings</em>, it proves that the most valued class of
               <em>Hebrew</em> servants were robbed of theirs also; a conclusion too
               stubborn for even pro-slavery masticators, however unscrupulous.

               one of his family, with as much as he can take with him&#8212;abundant
               benefits. And if it be avariciously asked, "How much must I give him?" I

               valuation of a servant, as declared in Ex. xxi. 32."&#8212;Maimonides,

               VII. The servants were BOUGHT. In other words, they received
               compensation in advance. Having shown, under a previous head,
               that servants <em>sold themselves</em>, and of course received the
               compensation for themselves, except in cases where parents hired out the time
               of their children till they became of age<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN13"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN13"></a>, a mere reference to the fact
               is all that is required for the purposes of this argument.

               VIII. We find masters at one time having a large number of servants,
               and afterwards none, without any intimation that they were
               sold. The wages of servants would enable them to set up in business
               for themselves. Jacob, after being Laban's servant for twenty-one
               years, became thus an independent herdsman, and was the master
               of many servants. Gen. xxx. 43, xxxii. 15. But all these servants
               had left him before he went down into Egypt, having doubtless
               acquired enough to commence business for themselves. Gen. xlv.
               10, 11; xlvi. 1-7, 32.

            </p>
            <p>
               IX. God's testimony to the character of Abraham. Gen. xviii.
               19. "For I know him that he will command his children and his
               household after him, and they shall keep, THE WAY OF THE LORD
               TO DO JUSTICE AND JUDGEMENT." God here testifies that Abraham
               taught his servants "the way of the Lord." What was the "way of
               the Lord" respecting the payment of wages where service was rendered?
               "Wo unto him that useth his neighbor's service WITHOUT
               WAGES!" Jer. xxii. 13. "Masters, give unto your servants that
               which is JUST AND EQUAL." Col. iv. 1. "Render unto all their

               DUES." Rom. xiii. 7. "The laborer is WORTHY OF HIS HIRE." Luke
               x. 7. How did Abraham teach his servants to "<em>do justice</em>" to
               others? By doing injustice to them? Did he exhort them to "render to all
               their dues" by keeping back <em>their own</em>? Did he teach them that
               "the laborer was worthy of his hire" by robbing them of <em>theirs</em>?
               Did he beget in them a reverence for honesty by pilfering all their time and
               labor? Did he teach them "not to defraud" others "in any matter"
               by denying them "what was just and equal?" If each of Abraham's
               pupils under such a catechism did not become a very
               <i>Aristides</i> in justice, then illustrious examples,
               patriarchal dignity, and <em>practical</em> lessons,
               can make but slow headway against human perverseness!

               X. <em>Specific precepts of the Mosaic law enforcing general
                  principles</em>. Out of many, we select the following: (1.) "Thou shalt not
               muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn," or literally, while he thresheth.
               Deut. xxv. 4. Here is a general principle applied to a familiar case.
               The ox representing all domestic animals. Isa. xxx. 24. A
               <em>particular</em> kind of service, <em>all</em> kinds; and a law
               requiring an abundant provision for the wants of an animal ministering to man
               in a <em>certain</em> way,&#8212;a general principle of treatment covering
               all times, modes, and instrumentalities of service. The object of the law was;
               not merely to enjoin tenderness towards brutes, but to inculcate the duty of
               rewarding those who serve us; and if such care be enjoined, by God, both
               for the ample sustenance and present enjoyment <em>of a brute</em>, what
               would be a meet return for the services of <em>man</em>?&#8212;MAN with
               his varied wants, exalted nature and immortal destiny! Paul says expressly,
               that this principle lies at the bottom of the statute. 1 Cor.
               ix. 9, 10, "For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not
               muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God
               take care for oxen? Or saith he it altogether for OUR SAKES? that
               he that ploweth should plow in HOPE, and that he that thresheth in
               hope should be PARTAKER OF HIS HOPE," (2.) "If thy brother be
               waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee, then thou shalt relieve
               him, YEA, THOUGH HE BE A STRANGER or a SOJOURNER that he may
               live with thee. Take thou no usury of him, or increase, but fear thy
               God. Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him
               thy victuals for increase." Lev. xxv. 35-37. Now, we ask, by
               what process of pro-slavery legerdemain, this regulation can be
               made to harmonize with the doctrine of WORK WITHOUT PAY? Did
               God declare the poor stranger entitled to RELIEF, and in the same

               breath, authorize them to "use his services without wages;" force
               him to work and ROB HIM OF HIS EARNINGS?

            <h3><a name="E4r3_noown"></a>V.&#8212;WERE MASTERS THE PROPRIETORS OF SERVANTS AS LEGAL
               PROPERTY?
            </h3>
            <p>
               The discussion of this topic has already been somewhat anticipated,
               but a variety of additional considerations remain to be noticed.

            </p>
            <p><a name="E4r3_noown_useprop"></a>
               1. Servants were not subjected to the uses nor liable to the contingencies
               of property. (1.) They were never taken in payment for
               their masters' debts, though children were sometimes taken (without
               legal authority) for the debts of a father. 2 Kings iv. 1; Job xxiv. 9;
               Isa. l., 1; Matt. xviii. 25. Creditors took from debtors property of all
               kinds, to satisfy their demands. Job xxiv. 3, cattle are taken; Prov.
               xxii. 27, household furniture; Lev. xxv. 25-28, the productions of
               the soil; Lev. xxv. 27-30, houses; Ex. xxii. 26-29, Deut. xxiv.
               10-13, Matt, v. 40, clothing; but <em>servants</em> were taken in
               <em>no instance</em>. (2.) Servants were never given as pledges. Property
               of all sorts was given in pledge. We find household furniture, clothing,
               cattle, money, signets, and personal ornaments, with divers other articles
               of property, used as pledges for value received; but no servants.
               (3.) All lost PROPERTY was to be restored. Oxen, asses, sheep,
               raiment, and "whatsoever lost things," are specified&#8212;servants
               <em>not</em>. Deut. xxii. 13. Besides, the Israelites were forbidden to
               return the runaway servant. Deut. xxiii. 15. (4.) The Israelites never gave
               away their servants as presents. They made costly presents, of
               great variety. Lands, houses, all kinds of animals, merchandise,
               family utensils, precious metals, grain, armor, &amp;c. are among their
               recorded <em>gifts</em>. Giving presents to superiors and persons of rank,
               was a standing usage. 1 Sam. x. 27; 1 Sam. xvi. 20; 2 Chron.
               xvii. 5. Abraham to Abimelech, Gen. xxi. 27; Jacob to the viceroy
               of Egypt, Gen. xliii. 11; Joseph to his brethren and father, Gen.
               xlv. 22, 23; Benhadad to Elisha, 2 Kings viii. 8, 9; Ahaz to Tiglath
               Pilezer, 2 Kings vi. 8; Solomon to the Queen of Sheba, 1
               Kings x. 13; Jeroboam to Ahijah, 1 Kings xiv. 3; Asa to Benhadad,
               1 Kings xv. 18, 19. But no servants were given as presents&#8212;though
               it was a prevailing fashion in the surrounding nations. Gen. xii. 16;
               Gen. xx. 14. It may be objected that Laban GAVE handmaids to his
               daughters, Jacob's wives. Without enlarging on the nature of the

               polygamy then prevalent suffice it to say that the handmaids of
               wives were regarded as wives, though of inferior dignity and authority.
               That Jacob so regarded his handmaids, is proved by his curse
               upon Reuben, Gen. xlix. 4, and Chron. v. 1; also by the equality of
               their children with those of Rachel and Leah. But had it been
               otherwise&#8212;had Laban given them as <em>articles of property</em>,
               then, indeed, the example of this "good old patriarch and slaveholder,"
               Saint Laban, would have been a forecloser to all argument. Ah! we
               remember his jealousy for <em>religion</em>&#8212;his holy indignation
               when he found that his "GODS" were stolen! How he mustered his clan,
               and plunged over the desert in hot pursuit, seven days, by forced
               marches; how he ransacked a whole caravan, sifting the contents of
               every tent, little heeding such small matters as domestic privacy, or
               female seclusion, for lo! the zeal of his "IMAGES" had eaten him
               up! No wonder that slavery, in its Bible-navigation, drifting dismantled
               before the free gusts, should scud under the lee of such a
               pious worthy to haul up and refit: invoking his protection, and the
               benediction of his "GODS!" <a name="E4r3_noown_distprop"></a>"Again,
               it may be objected that, servants
               were enumerated in inventories of property. If that proves
               <em>servants</em> property, it proves <em>wives</em> property.
               "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy
               neighbor's WIFE, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox,
               nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's." Ex. xx. 17. In
               inventories of <em>mere property</em> if servants are included, it is in
               such a way, as to show that they are not regarded as <em>property</em>.
               See Eccl. ii. 7, 8. But when the design is to show not merely the wealth, but
               the <em>greatness</em> of any personage, servants are spoken of, as well
               as property. In a word, if <em>riches</em> alone are spoken of, no mention
               is made of servants; if <em>greatness</em>, servants and property.
               Gen. xiii. 2. "And Abraham was very rich in cattle, in silver and in gold." So
               in the fifth verse, "And Lot also had flocks, and herds, and tents." In the
               seventh verse servants are mentioned, "And there was a strife between the
               HERDMEN of Abraham's cattle and the HERDMEN of Lot's cattle." See also Josh.
               xxii. 8; Gen. xxxiv. 23; Job xlii. 12; 2 Chron. xxi. 3; xxxii. 27-29;
               Job i. 3-5; Deut. viii. 12-17; Gen. xxiv. 35, xxvi. 13, xxx. 43.
               Jacobs's wives say to him, "All the <em>riches</em> which thou hast taken
               from our father that is ours and our children's." Then follows an inventory
               of property. "All his cattle," "all his goods," "the cattle of his getting."
               He had a large number of servants at the time but they are not

               included with his property. Comp. Gen. xxx. 43, with Gen. xxxi.
               16-18. When he sent messengers to Esau, wishing to impress him
               with an idea of his state and sway, he bade them tell him not only of
               his RICHES, but of his GREATNESS; that Jacob had "oxen, and asses,
               and flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants." Gen. xxxii. 4, 5.
               Yet in the present which he sent, there were no servants; though
               he seems to have sought as much variety as possible. Gen. xxxii.
               14, 15; see also Gen. xxxvi. 6, 7; Gen. xxxiv. 23. As flocks and
               herds were the staples of wealth, a large number of servants presupposed
               large possessions of cattle, which would require many herdsmen.
               When servants are spoken of in connection with <em>mere property</em>,
               the terms used to express the latter do not include the former. The
               Hebrew word <i>Mikn&#277;</i>, is an
               illustration. It is derived from
               <i>K&#257;n&#257;</i>, to
               procure, to buy, and its meaning is, <i>a possession,
                  wealth, riches</i>. It occurs more than forty times in the Old Testament,
               and is applied always to <em>mere property</em>, generally to domestic
               animals, but never to servants. In some instances, servants are mentioned in
               distinction from the <i>Mikn&#277;</i>.
               <a name="E4r3_noown_gen_12_5"></a> And Abraham took Sarah his wife, and Lot
               his brother's son, and all their
               SUBSTANCE that they had gathered; and the souls that they had gotten in Haran,
               and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan."&#8212;Gen. xii. 5. Many
               will have it, that these <em>souls</em> were a part of Abraham's
               <em>substance</em> (notwithstanding the pains here taken to separate them
               from it)&#8212;that they were slaves taken with him in his migration as a part
               of his family effects. Who but slaveholders, either actually or in heart,
               would torture into the principle and practice of slavery, such a harmless
               phrase as "<em>the souls that they had gotten</em>?" Until the slave
               trade breathed its haze upon the vision of the church, and smote her with
               palsy and decay, commentators saw no slavery in, "The souls that they had
               gotten." In the Targum of Onkelos<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN14"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN14"></a> it is rendered,
               "The souls whom they had brought to obey the law in Haran." In the Targum of
               Jonathan, "The souls whom they had made proselytes in Haran." In the

               Targum of Jerusalem, "The souls proselyted in Haran." Jarchi,
               the prince of Jewish commentators, "The souls whom they had
               brought under the Divine wings." Jerome, one of the most learned
               of the Christian fathers, "The persons whom they had proselyted."
               The Persian version, the Vulgate, the Syriac, the Arabic, and the
               Samaritan all render it, "All the wealth which they had gathered,
               and the souls which they had made in Haran." Menochius, a commentator
               who wrote before our present translation of the Bible, renders
               it, "Quas de idolatraria converterant." "Those whom they
               had converted from idolatry."&#8212;Paulus
               Fagius<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN15"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN15"></a>. "Quas instituerant
               in religione." "Those whom they had established in religion." Luke
               Francke, a German commentator who lived two centuries ago.
               "Quas legi subjicerant"&#8212;"Those whom they had brought to obey
               the law."

               Chaldee paraphrases of parts of the Old Testament. The Targum of Onkelas is,

               and was probably made at about the commencement of the Christian era.
               The Targum of Jonathan Ben Uzziel, bears about the same date. The Targum of
               Jerusalem was probably about five hundred years later. The Israelites, during
               their captivity in Babylon, lost, as a body, their own language. These
               translations into the Chaldee, the language which they acquired in Babylon,
               were thus called for by the necessity of the case.

               II. The condition and treatment of servants make the doctrine
               that they were mere COMMODITIES, an absurdity. St. Paul's testimony
               in Gal. iv. 1, shows the condition of servants: "Now I say unto you,
               that the heir, so long as he is a child, DIFFERETH NOTHING FROM A
               SERVANT, though he be lord of all." That Abraham's servants were
               voluntary, that their interests were identified with those of their
               master's family, and that the utmost confidence was reposed in them,
               is shown in their being armed.&#8212;Gen. xiv. 14, 15. When Abraham's
               servant went to Padanaram, the young Princess Rebecca did not disdain
               to say to him, "Drink, MY LORD," as "she hasted and let down
               her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink." Laban, the brother
               of Rebecca, "ungirded his camels, and brought him water to wash
               his feet and the men's feet that were with him!" In 1 Sam. ix. is
               an account of a festival in the city of Zuph, at which Samuel presided.
               None but those bidden, sat down at the feast, and only "about thirty
               persons" were invited. Quite a select party!&#8212;the elite of the city.
               Saul and his servant had just arrived at Zuph, and <em>both</em> of them,
               at Samuel's solicitation, accompany him as invited guests. "And Samuel
               took Saul and his SERVANT, and brought THEM into the PARLOR(!)
               and made THEM sit in the CHIEFEST SEATS among those that were
               bidden." A <em>servant</em> invited by the chief judge, ruler, and
               prophet in

               Israel, to dine publicly with a select party, in company with his
               master, who was at the same time anointed King of Israel! and this
               servant introduced by Samuel into the PARLOR, and assigned, with his
               master, to the <em>chiefest seat</em> at the table! This was
               "<em>one</em> of the servants"
               of Kish, Saul's father; not the steward or the chief of them&#8212;not
               at all a <em>picked</em> man, but "<em>one</em> of the servants;"
               <em>any</em> one that could be most easily spared, as no endowments
               specially rare would be likely to find scope in looking after asses. Again:
               we find Elah, the King of Israel, at a festive entertainment, in the house of
               Arza, his steward, or head servant, with whom he seems to have been on terms
               of familiarity.&#8212;1 Kings xvi. 8, 9. See also the intercourse between
               Gideon and his servant.&#8212;Judg. vii. 10, 11. Jonathan and his
               servant.&#8212;1 Sam. xiv. 1-14. Elisha and his servant.&#8212;2 Kings iv. v.
               vi.

               III. The case of the Gibeonites. The condition of the inhabitants
               of Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim, under the
               Hebrew commonwealth, is quoted in triumph by the advocates of
               slavery; and truly they are right welcome to all the crumbs that can
               be gleaned from it. Milton's devils made desperate snatches at fruit
               that turned to ashes on their lips. The spirit of slavery raves under
               tormenting gnawings, and casts about in blind phrenzy for something
               to ease, or even to <em>mock</em> them. But for this, it would never have
               clutched at the Gibeonites, for even the incantations of the demon
               cauldron, could not extract from their case enough to tantalize starvation's
               self. But to the question. What was the condition of the
               Gibeonites under the Israelites? (1.) <em>It was voluntary</em>.
               Their own
               proposition to Joshua was to become servants. Josh. ix. 8, 11. It was
               accepted, but the kind of service which they should perform, was not
               specified until their gross imposition came to light; they were then
               assigned to menial offices in the Tabernacle. (2.) <em>They were not
                  domestic servants in the families of the Israelites</em>. They still
               resided in their own cities, cultivated their own fields, tended their flocks
               and herds, and exercised the functions of a <em>distinct</em>, though not
               independent community. They were subject to the Jewish nation as
               <i>tributaries</i>. So far from being distributed among
               the Israelites, and their internal organization as a distinct people
               abolished, they remained a separate, and, in some respects, an independent
               community for many centuries. When attacked by the Amorites, they applied to
               the Israelites as confederates for aid&#8212;it was rendered, their enemies
               routed, and themselves left unmolested in their cities. Josh. x. 6-18.

               Long afterwards, Saul slew some of them, and God sent upon Israel
               a three years' famine for it. David inquired of the Gibeonites, "What
               shall I do for you, and wherewith shall I make the atonement?"
               At their demand, he delivered up to them, seven of Saul's descendants.
               2 Sam. xxi. 1-9. The whole transaction was a formal recognition
               of the Gibeonites as a distinct people. There is no intimation
               that they served families, or individuals of the Israelites, but only the
               "house of God," or the Tabernacle. This was established first at
               Gilgal, a day's journey from their cities; and then at Shiloh, nearly
               two day's journey from them; where it continued about 350 years.
               During this period, the Gibeonites inhabited their ancient cities and
               territory. Only a few, comparatively, could have been absent at any
               one time in attendance on the Tabernacle. Wherever allusion is made
               to them in the history, the main body are spoken of as <em>at home</em>.
               It is preposterous to suppose that all the inhabitants of these four cities
               could find employment at the Tabernacle. One of them "was a great
               city, as one of the royal cities;" so large, that a confederacy of five
               kings, apparently the most powerful in the land, was deemed necessary
               for its destruction. It is probable that the men were divided into
               classes, ministering in rotation&#8212;each class a few days or weeks
               at a time. This service was their <i>national tribute</i>
               to the Israelites, for the privilege of residence and protection under their
               government. No service seems to have been required of the
               <em>females</em>. As these Gibeonites were Canaanites, and as they had
               greatly exasperated the Israelites by impudent imposition, and lying, we might
               assuredly expect that they would reduce <em>them</em> to the condition of
               chattels if there was <em>any</em> case in which God permitted them to do
               so.

               IV. Throughout the Mosaic system, God warns the Israelites against
               holding their servants in such a condition as they were held in by the
               Egyptians. How often are they pointed back to the grindings of their
               prison-house! What motives to the exercise of justice and kindness
               towards their servants, are held out to their fears in threatened
               judgments; to their hopes in promised good; and to all within them
               that could feel; by those oft repeated words of tenderness and terror!
               "For ye were bondmen in the land of Egypt"&#8212;waking anew the
               memory of tears and anguish, and of the wrath that avenged them.

            </p>
            <p>
               God's denunciations against the bondage of Egypt make it incumbent
               on us to ascertain, of what rights the Israelites were plundered,
               and what they retained.

            </p>
            <p>
               EGYPTIAN BONDAGE ANALYZED. (1.) The Israelites were not
               dispersed among the families of Egypt<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN16"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN16"></a>, but formed a
               separate community. Gen. xlvi. 35. Ex. viii. 22, 24; ix. 26; x. 23; xi. 7; ii.
               9; xvi. 22; xvii. 5. (2.) They had the exclusive possession of the
               land of Goshen<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN17"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN17"></a>. Gen. xlv. 18; xlvii. 6, 11, 27. Ex. xii. 4, 19, 22,
               23, 27. (3.) They lived in permanent dwellings. These were
               <em>houses</em>, not <em>tents</em>. In Ex. xii. 6, 22, the two side
               <em>posts</em>, and the upper door <em>posts</em>, and the lintel of
               the houses are mentioned. Each family seems to have occupied a house
               <em>by itself</em>,&#8212;Acts vii. 20. Ex. xii. 4&#8212;and
               judging from the regulation about the eating of the Passover, they
               could hardly have been small ones, Ex. xii. 4, probably contained separate
               apartments, and places for concealment. Ex. ii. 2, 3; Acts
               vii. 20. They appear to have been well apparelled. Ex. xii. 11.
               To have their own burial grounds. Ex. xiii. 19, and xiv. 11.
               (4.) They owned "a mixed multitude of flocks and herds," and
               "very much cattle." Ex. xii. 32, 37, 38. (5.) They had their own
               form of government, and preserved their tribe and family divisions,
               and their internal organization throughout, though still a province of
               Egypt, and <i>tributary</i> to it. Ex. ii. 1;
               xii. 19, 21; vi. 14, 25; v. 19; iii. 16, 18. (6.) They seem to have had in
               a considerable measure, the disposal of their own time,&#8212;Ex. xxiii. 4;
               iii. 16, 18, xii. 6; ii. 9; and iv. 27, 29-31. And to have practiced the fine
               arts. Ex. xxxii. 4; xxxv. 22-35. (7.) They were all armed. Ex. xxxii. 27.
               (8.) They held their possessions independently, and the Egyptians seem
               to have regarded them as inviolable. No intimation is given that the
               Egyptians dispossessed them of their habitations, or took away their
               flocks, or herds, or crops, or implements of agriculture, or any article
               of property. (9.) All the females seem to have known something
               of domestic refinements; they were familiar with instruments of music,
               and skilled in the working of fine fabrics. Ex. xv. 20; xxxv. 25, 26.
               (10.) Service seems to have been exacted from none but adult males.
               Nothing is said from which the bond service of females could he inferred;

               the hiding of Moses three months by his mother, and the
               payment of wages to her by Pharaoh's daughter, go against such a
               supposition. Ex. ii. 29. (11.) So far from being fed upon a given
               allowance, their food was abundant, and of great variety. "They
               sat by the flesh-pots," and "did eat bread to the full." Ex. xvi. 3;
               xxiv. 1; xvii. 5; iv. 29; vi. 14; "they did eat fish freely, and
               cucumbers, and melons, and leeks, and onions, and garlic." Num.
               xi. 4, 5; x. 18; xx. 5. (12.) The great body of the people were
               not in the service of the Egyptians. (a.) The extent and variety
               of their own possessions, together with such a cultivation of their
               crops as would provide them with bread, and such care of their
               immense flocks and herds, as would secure their profitable increase,
               must have furnished constant employment for the main
               body of the nation. (b.) During the plague of darkness, God informs
               us that "ALL the children of Israel had light in their dwellings."
               We infer that they were <em>there</em> to enjoy it. (c.) It seems
               improbable that the making of brick, the only service named during the
               latter part of their sojourn in Egypt, could have furnished permanent
               employment for the bulk of the nation. See also Ex. iv. 29-31.
               Besides, when Eastern nations employed tributaries, it was as
               now, in the use of the levy, requiring them to furnish a given
               quota, drafted off periodically, so that comparatively but a small
               portion of the nation would be absent <em>at any one time</em>. Probably
               one-fifth part of the proceeds of their labor was required of the
               Israelites in common with the Egyptians. Gen. xlvii. 24, 26.
               Instead of taking it from their <em>crops</em>, (Goshen being better for
               <em>pasturage</em>) they exacted it of them in brick making; and it is
               quite probable that labor was exacted only from the <em>poorer</em>
               Israelites, the wealthy being able to pay their tribute in money.
               Ex. iv. 27-31. Contrast this bondage of Egypt with American slavery. Have our
               slaves "very much cattle," and "a mixed multitude of flocks and
               herds?" Do they live in commodious houses of their own, "sit by the
               flesh-pots," "eat fish freely," and "eat bread to the full?" Do they
               live in a separate community, in their distinct tribes, under their own
               rulers, in the exclusive occupation of an extensive tract of country
               for the culture of their crops, and for rearing immense herds of their
               own cattle&#8212;and all these held inviolable by their masters? Are
               our female slaves free from exactions of labor and liabilities of
               outrage? or when employed, are they paid wages, as was the Israelitish

               woman by the king's daughter? Have they the disposal of their own
               time and the means for cultivating social refinements, for practising
               the fine arts, and for personal improvement? THE ISRAELITES
               UNDER THE BONDAGE OF EGYPT, ENJOYED ALL THESE RIGHTS AND
               PRIVILEGES. True, "all the service wherein they made them serve
               was with rigor." But what was this when compared with the incessant
               toil of American slaves, the robbery of all their time and earnings,
               and even the power to "own any thing, or acquire any thing?"
               a "quart of corn a-day," the legal allowance of
               food<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN18"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN18"></a>!

               <em>hovels</em>, unfit for human residence, with but one apartment, where
               both sexes and all ages herd promiscuously at night, like the beasts of the
               field. Add to this, the ignorance, and degradation; the daily sundering of
               kindred, the revelries of lust, the lacerations and baptisms of blood,
               sanctioned by law, and patronized by public sentiment. What was the bondage of
               Egypt when compared with this? And yet for her oppression of the poor,
               God smote her with plagues, and trampled her as the mire, till she
               passed away in his wrath, and the place that knew her in her pride,
               knew her no more. Ah! "I have seen the afflictions of my people,
               and I have heard their groanings, and am come down to deliver them."
               HE DID COME, and Egypt sank a ruinous heap, and her blood closed
               over her. If such was God's retribution for the oppression of
               heathen Egypt, of how much sorer punishment shall a Christian people
               be thought worthy, who cloak with religion a system, in comparison
               with which the bondage of Egypt dwindles to nothing? Let
               those believe who can that God commissioned his people to rob
               others of <em>all</em> their rights, while he denounced against them wrath
               to the uttermost, if they practised the <em>far lighter</em> oppression of
               Egypt&#8212;which robbed it's victims of only the least and cheapest of their
               rights, and left the females unplundered even of these. What! Is God
               divided against himself? When He had just turned Egypt into a
               funeral pile; while his curse yet blazed upon her unburied dead, and
               his bolts still hissed amidst her slaughter, and the smoke of her torment
               went upwards because she had "ROBBED THE POOR," did He

               license the victims of robbery to rob the poor of ALL? As
               <em>Lawgiver</em> did he <em>create</em> a system tenfold more
               grinding than that for which he had just hurled Pharaoh headlong, and
               overwhelmed his princes, and his hosts, till "hell was moved to meet them at
               their coming?"

            <p>
               The advocates of slavery find themselves at their wits end in
               pressing the Bible into their service. Every movement shows them
               hard-pushed. Their ever-varying shifts, their forced constructions,
               and blind guesswork, proclaim both their <em>cause</em> desperate, and
               themselves. The Bible defences thrown around slavery by professed
               ministers of the Gospel, do so torture common sense, Scripture, and
               historical facts it were hard to tell whether absurdity, fatuity, ignorance,
               or blasphemy, predominates in the compound; each strives so
               lustily for the mastery it may be set down a drawn battle. How
               often has it been bruited that the color of the negro is the
               <i>Cain-mark</i>, propagated downward. Cain's posterity
               started an opposition to the ark, forsooth, and rode out the flood with flying
               streamers! Why should not a miracle be wrought to point such an argument, and
               fill out for slaveholders a Divine title-deed, vindicating the ways of God
               to man?

               OBJECTION 1. "Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he
               be unto his brethren." Gen. ix. 25.

            </p>
            <p>
               This prophecy of Noah is the <i>vade mecum</i> of slaveholders, and
               they never venture abroad without it; it is a pocket-piece for sudden
               occasion, a keepsake to dote over, a charm to spell-bind opposition,
               and a magnet to draw around their standard "whatsoever worketh
               abomination or maketh a lie." But "cursed be Canaan" is a poor
               drug to ease a throbbing conscience&#8212;a mocking lullaby, to unquiet
               tossings, and vainly crying "Peace be still," where God wakes war,
               and breaks his thunders. Those who justify negro slavery by the
               curse of Canaan, <em>assume</em> all the points in debate. (1.) That
               <em>slavery</em> was prophesied rather than mere <em>service</em>
               to others, and <em>individual</em> bondage rather than
               <em>national</em> subjection and tribute. (2.) That the
               <em>prediction</em> of crime <em>justifies</em> it; at least absolving
               those whose crimes fulfill it, if not transforming the crimes into
               <em>virtues</em>. How piously the Pharoahs

               might have quoted the prophecy <em>"Thy seed shall be a stranger
                  in a land that is not theirs, and they shall afflict there four hundred
                  years."</em> And then, what <em>saints</em> were those that crucified
               the Lord of glory! (3.) That the Africans are descended from Canaan. Whereas
               Africa was peopled from Egypt and Ethiopia, and they were settled
               by Mizraim and Cush. For the location and boundaries of
               Canaan's posterity, see Gen. x. 15-19. So a prophecy of evil to
               one people, is quoted to justify its infliction upon another. Perhaps
               it may be argued that Canaan includes all Ham's posterity. If so,
               the prophecy is yet unfulfilled. The other sons of Ham settled
               Egypt and Assyria, and, conjointly with Shem, Persia, and afterward,
               to some extent, the Grecian and Roman empires. The history
               of these nations gives no verification of the prophecy. Whereas,
               the history of Canaan's descendants for more than three thousand
               years, records its fulfilment. First, they were put to tribute by the
               Israelites; then by the Medes and Persians; then by the Macedonians,
               Grecians and Romans, successively; and finally, were subjected
               by the Ottoman dynasty, where they yet remain. Thus Canaan
               has been for ages the servant mainly of Shem and Japhet, and
               secondarily of the other sons of Ham. It may still be objected, that
               though Canaan alone is <em>named</em> in the curse, yet the 23d and 24th
               verses show the posterity of Ham in general to be meant. "And
               Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told
               his two brethren without." "And Noah awoke from his wine, and
               knew what his YOUNGER son had done unto him, and said," &amp;c. It
               is argued that this "<em>younger</em> son" can not be <em>Canaan</em>,
               as he was the <em>grandson</em> of Noah, and therefore it must be
               <em>Ham.</em> We answer, whoever that "<em>younger son</em>" was,
               <em>Canaan</em> alone was named in the curse. Besides, the Hebrew word
               <i>Ben</i>, signifies son, grandson, or
               <em>any</em> of <em>one</em> the posterity of an individual.
               "<em>Know ye Laban the SON of Nahor?</em>" Laban was the
               <em>grandson</em> of Nahor. Gen. xxix. 5. "<em>Mephibosheth the SON of
                  Saul</em>." 2 Sam. xix. 24. Mephibosheth was the <em>grandson</em> of
               Saul. 2 Sam. ix. 6. "<i>There is a SON born to
                  Naomi.</i>" Ruth iv. 17. This was the son of Ruth, the daughter-in-law
               of Naomi. "<em>Let seven men of his (Saul's) SONS be delivered
                  unto us.</em>" 2 Sam. xxi. 6. Seven of Saul's <em>grandsons</em> were
               delivered up. "<em>Laban rose up and kissed his SONS.</em>" Gen. xxi. 55.
               These were his <em>grandsons</em>. "<em>The driving of Jehu the SON of
                  Nimshi.</em>" 2 Kings ix. 20. Jehu was the <em>grandson</em> of Nimshi.
               Shall we forbid the inspired writer to

               use the <em>same</em> word when speaking of <em>Noah's</em> grandson?
               Further; Ham was not the "<em>younger</em>" son. The order of enumeration
               makes him the <em>second</em> son. If it be said that Bible usage varies,
               the order of birth not always being observed in enumerations, the reply is,
               that, enumeration in that order is the <em>rule</em>, in any other order
               the <em>exception</em>. Besides, if a younger member of a family, takes
               precedence of older ones in the family record, it is a mark of pre-eminence,
               either in endowments, or providential instrumentality. Abraham,
               though sixty years younger than his eldest brother, stands first in the
               family genealogy. Nothing in Ham's history shows him pre-eminent;
               besides, the Hebrew word
               <i>H&#259;kk&#257;t&#257;n</i>
               rendered "the <em>younger</em>," means the <em>little, small</em>.
               The same word is used in Isa. xl. 22. "<em>A LITTLE ONE shall become a
                  thousand</em>." Isa. xxii. 24. "<em>All vessels of SMALL
                  quantity</em>." Ps. cxv. 13. "<em>He will bless them that fear the
                  Lord both SMALL and great</em>." Ex. xviii. 22. "<em>But every SMALL
                  matter they shall judge</em>." It would be a literal rendering of
               Gen. ix. 24, if it were translated thus. "When Noah knew what his little
               son<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN21"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN21"></a>, or
               grandson (<i>B&#275;no
                  H&#259;kk&#257;t&#257;n</i>) had done unto him, he said cursed be
               Canaan," &amp;c. Further, even if the Africans were the descendants of
               Canaan, the assumption that their enslavement fulfils this prophecy,
               lacks even plausibility, for, only a <em>fraction</em> of the Africans
               have at any time been the slaves of other nations. If the objector say in
               reply, that a large majority of the Africans have always been slaves
               <em>at home</em>, we answer: <em>It is false in point of fact</em>,
               though zealously bruited often to serve a turn; and <em>if it were
                  true</em>, how does it help the argument? The prophecy was, "Cursed be
               Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be <em>unto his</em> BRETHREN,"
               not unto <em>himself</em>!

               OBJECTION II.&#8212;"If a man smite his servant or his maid with a
               rod, and he die under his hand, he shall surely be punished. Notwithstanding,
               if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished,
               for he is his money." Ex. xxi. 20, 21. What was the design of
               this regulation? Was it to grant masters an indulgence to beat servants
               with impunity, and an assurance, that if they beat them to
               death, the offense shall not be <em>capital</em>? This is substantially
               what commentators tell us. What Deity do such men worship?
               Some blood-gorged Moloch, enthroned on human hecatombs, and
               snuffing carnage for incense? Did He who thundered from Sinai's

               flames, "THOU SHALT NOT KILL," offer a bounty on <em>murder</em>? Whoever
               analyzes the Mosaic system, will find a moot court in session,
               trying law points&#8212;settling definitions, or laying down rules of
               evidence, in almost every chapter. Num. xxxv. 10-22; Deut. xi. 11,
               and xix. 4-6; Lev. xxiv. 19-22; Ex. xxi. 18, 19, are a few, out of
               many cases stated, with tests furnished the judges by which to detect
               <em>the intent</em>, in actions brought before them. Their ignorance of
               judicial proceedings, laws of evidence, &amp;c., made such instructions
               necessary. The detail gone into, in the verses quoted, is manifestly to
               enable them to get at the <em>motive</em> and find out whether the master
               <em>designed</em> to kill. (1.) "If a man smite his servant with a
               <em>rod</em>."&#8212;The instrument used, gives a clue to the
               <em>intent</em>. See Num. xxxv. 16, 18. A <em>rod</em>, not an axe,
               nor a sword, nor a bludgeon, nor any other death-weapon&#8212;hence, from the
               <em>kind</em> of instrument, no design to <em>kill</em> would be
               inferred; for <em>intent</em> to kill would hardly have taken a
               <em>rod</em> for its weapon. But if the servant die <em>under his
                  hand</em>, then the unfitness of the instrument, is point blank against him;
               for, to strike him with a <em>rod</em> until he <em>dies</em>, argues
               a great many blows and great violence, and this kept up to the death-gasp,
               showed an <em>intent to kill</em>. Hence "He shall <em>surely</em> be
               punished." But if he continued <em>a day or two</em>, the <em>length of
                  time that he lived</em>, together with the <em>kind</em> of instrument
               used, and the master's pecuniary interest in his <em>life</em>, ("he is
               his <em>money</em>,") all made a strong case of circumstantial evidence,
               showing that the master did not design to kill. Further, the word
               <i>n&#257;k&#259;m</i>,
               here rendered <em>punished</em>, is <em>not so rendered in another
                  instance</em>. Yet it occurs thirty-five times in the Old Testament, and in
               almost every place is translated "<em>avenge</em>," in a few, "<em>to
                  take vengeance</em>," or "<em>to revenge</em>,"
               and in this instance ALONE, "<em>punish</em>." As it stands in our
               translation, the pronoun preceding it, refers to the <em>master</em>,
               whereas it should refer to the <em>crime</em>, and the word rendered
               <em>punished</em>, should have been rendered <em>avenged</em>.
               The meaning is this: If a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and
               he die under his hand, IT (the death) shall surely be avenged, or literally,
               <em>by avenging it shall be avenged</em>; that is, the <em>death</em>
               of the servant shall be <em>avenged</em> by the <em>death</em>
               of the master. So in the next verse, "If he continue a day or two,"
               his death is not to be avenged by the <em>death</em> of the
               <em>master</em>, as in that case the crime was to be adjudged
               <i>manslaughter</i>, and not
               <i>murder</i>. In the following verse, another case of
               personal injury is stated, for which the injurer is to pay a <em>sum of
                  money</em>; and yet our translators

               employ the same phraseology in both places. One, an instance of
               deliberate, wanton, killing by piecemeal. The other, an accidental,
               and comparatively slight injury&#8212;of the inflicter, in both cases, they
               say the same thing! "He shall surely be punished." Now, just the
               discrimination to be looked for where God legislates, is marked in
               the original. In the case of the servant wilfully murdered, He says,
               "It (the death) shall surely be <em>avenged</em>," that is, the life of
               the wrong doer shall expiate the crime. The same word is used in the Old
               Testament, when the greatest wrongs are redressed, by devoting the
               perpetrators to <em>destruction</em>. In the case of the unintentional
               injury, in the following verse, God says, "He shall surely be
               <em>fined</em>," (<em>Aunash</em>.) "He shall <em>pay</em> as the
               judges determine." The simple meaning of the word
               <i>&#257;n&#259;sh</i>, is to lay a fine.
               It is used in Deut. xxii. 19: "They shall amerce him in one hundred shekels,"
               and in 2 Chron. xxxvi. 3: "He condemned (<i>mulcted</i>)
               the land in a hundred talents of gold." That <em>avenging</em> the death
               of the servant, was neither imprisonment, nor stripes, nor a fine, but that it
               was <em>taking the master's life</em> we infer, (1.) From the
               <em>use</em> of the word
               <i>n&#257;k&#259;m</i>. See Gen. iv. 24;
               Josh. x. 13; Judg. xiv. 7; xvi. 28; I Sam. xiv. 24; xviii. 25; xxv. 31; 2 Sam.
               iv. 8; Judg. v. 2: I Sam. xxv. 26-33. (2.) From the express statute,
               Lev. xxiv. 17; "He that killeth ANY man shall surely be put to death."
               Also Num. xxxv. 30, 31: "Whoso killeth ANY person, the murderer shall be put
               to death. Moreover, ye shall take NO SATISFACTION for the life of a murderer
               which is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death." (3.) The
               Targum of Jonathan gives the verse thus, "Death by the sword shall surely be
               adjudged." The Targum of Jerusalem. "Vengeance shall be taken for him to the
               <em>uttermost</em>." Jarchi, the same. The Samaritan version: "He shall
               die the death," Again the clause "for he is his money," is quoted to prove
               that the servant is his master's property, and therefore, if he died, the
               master was not to be punished. The assumption is, that the phrase, "HE IS HIS
               MONEY." proves not only that the servant is <em>worth money</em> to the
               master, but that he is an <em>article of property</em>. If the advocates
               of slavery insist upon taking the principle of interpretation into the Bible,
               and turning it loose, let them stand and draw in self-defence. If they
               endorse for it at one point, they must stand sponsors all around the circle.
               It will be too late to cry for quarter when its stroke clears the table, and
               tilts them among the sweepings beneath. The Bible abounds with such
               expressions as the following: "This (bread) is my

               body;" "this (wine) <em>is</em> my blood;" "all they (the Israelites)
               <em>are</em> brass and tin;" "this (water) <em>is</em> the blood of
               the men who went in jeopardy of their lives;" "the Lord God <em>is</em>
               a sun and a shield;" "God <em>is</em> love;" "the seven good ears
               <em>are</em> seven years, and the seven good kine <em>are</em>
               seven years;" "the tree of the field <em>is</em> man's life;" "God
               <em>is</em> a consuming fire;" "he <em>is</em> his money," &amp;c.
               A passion for the exact <em>literalities</em> of the Bible is so amiable,
               it were hard not to gratify it in this case. The words in the original are
               (<i>K&#257;spo-hu</i>,) "his
               <em>silver</em> is he." The objector's principle of interpretation is a
               philosopher's stone! Its miracle touch transmutes five feet eight inches
               of flesh and bones into <em>solid silver!</em> Quite a
               <em>permanent</em> servant, if not so nimble with all&#8212;reasoning
               against "<em>forever</em>," is forestalled henceforth, and,
               Deut. xxiii. 15, utterly outwitted. The obvious meaning of the phrase,
               "<em>He is his money</em>," is, he is <em>worth money</em> to his
               master, and since, if the master had killed him, it would have taken money
               out of his pocket, the <em>pecuniary loss</em>, the <em>kind of
                  instrument used</em>, and <em>the fact of his living some time after the
                  injury</em>, (if the master <em>meant</em> to kill, he would be likely
               to <em>do</em> it while about it,) all together make a strong case of
               presumptive evidence clearing the master of <em>intent to kill</em>. But
               let us look at the objector's <em>inferences</em>. One is, that as the
               master might dispose of his <em>property</em> as he pleased, he was not to
               be punished, if he destroyed it. Whether the servant died under the master's
               hand, or after a day or two, he was <em>equally</em> his property, and the
               objector admits that in the <em>first</em> case the master is to be
               "surely punished" for destroying <em>his own property!</em> The other
               inference is, that since the continuance of a day or two, cleared the master
               of <em>intent to kill</em>, the loss of the slave would be a
               sufficient punishment for inflicting the injury which caused his death.
               This inference makes the Mosaic law false to its own principles. A
               <em>pecuniary loss</em> was no part of the legal claim, where a person
               took the <em>life</em> of another. In such case, the law spurned money,
               whatever the sum. God would not cheapen human life, by balancing it with
               such a weight. "Ye shall take NO SATISFACTION for the life of a
               murderer, but he shall surely be put to death." Num. xxxv. 31. Even
               in excusable homicide, where an axe slipped from the helve and killed
               a man, no sum of money availed to release from confinement in
               the city of refuge, until the death of the High Priest. Numb. xxxv.
               32. The doctrine that the loss of the servant would be a penalty
               <em>adequate</em> to the desert of the master, admits his
               <em>guilt</em> and his desert

               of <em>some</em> punishment, and it prescribes a kind of punishment,
               rejected by the law in all cases where man took the life of man, whether
               with or without the intent to kill. In short, the objector annuls an integral
               part of the system&#8212;makes a <em>new</em> law, and coolly metes
               out such penalty as he thinks fit. Divine legislation revised and improved!
               The master who struck out his servant's tooth, whether intentionally
               or not, was required to set him free. The <em>pecuniary loss</em> to the
               master was the same as though he had killed him. Look at the two
               cases. A master beats his servant so that he dies of his wounds;
               another accidentally strikes out his servant's tooth,&#8212;<em>the
                  pecuniary loss of both cases is the same</em>. If the loss of the slave's
               services is punishment sufficient for the crime of killing him, would
               <em>God</em> command the <em>same</em> punishment for the
               <em>accidental</em> knocking out of a <em>tooth?</em> Indeed, unless
               the injury was done <em>inadvertantly</em>, the loss of the servant's
               services was only a <em>part</em> of the punishment&#8212;mere reparation
               to the <em>individual</em> for injury done; the <em>main</em>
               punishment, that strictly <em>judicial</em>, was reparation to the
               <em>community</em>. To set the servant free, and thus proclaim his injury,
               his right to redress, and the measure of it&#8212;answered not the ends of
               <em>public</em> justice. The law made an example of the offender. That
               "those that remain might hear and fear." "If a man cause a blemish in his
               neighbor, as he hath done, so shall it be done unto him. Breach for breach,
               eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Ye shall have one manner of law as well for the
               STRANGER as for one of your own country." Lev xxiv. 19, 20, 22. Finally, if a
               master smote out his servant's tooth the law smote out <em>his</em>
               tooth&#8212;thus redressing the <em>public</em> wrong; and it cancelled
               the servant's obligation to the master, thus giving some compensation for the
               injury done, and exempting him form perilous liabilities in future.

               OBJECTION III. "Both thy bondmen and bondmaids which thou

               The <em>points</em> in these verses urged as proof, that the Mosaic system
               sanctioned slavery, are 1. The word "BONDMEN." 2. "BUY."
               3. "INHERITANCE AND POSSESSION." and 4. "FOREVER."

            <p>
               The <em>buying</em> of servants was discussed, pp. 17-22, and holding
               them as a "possession." pp. 37-46. We will now ascertain what
               sanction to slavery is derivable from the terms "bondmen," "inheritance,"
               and "forever."

            <p><a name="E4r3_Lev25_44_bond"></a>
               1. "BONDMEN." The fact that servants from the heathen are called
               "<em>bondmen</em>," while others are called "<em>servants</em>," is
               quoted as proof that the former were slaves. As the caprices of King James'
               translators were not inspired, we need stand in no special awe of them.
               The word here rendered bondmen is uniformly rendered servants
               elsewhere. The Hebrew word
               "<i>&#277;b&#277;dh</i>," the plural of
               which is here translated "bondmen," is in Isa. xlii. 1, applied to Christ.
               "Behold my <em>servant</em> (bondman, slave?) whom I have chosen." So
               Isa. lii. 13. "Behold my <em>servant</em> (Christ) shall deal prudently."
               In 1 Kings xii. 6, 7, to <em>King Rehoboam</em>. "And they spake unto
               him, saying if thou wilt be a <em>servant</em> unto this people, then
               they will be thy <em>servants</em> forever." In 2 Chron. xii. 7, 8, 9, 13,
               to the king and all the nation. In fine, the word is applied to
               <em>all</em> persons doing service for others&#8212;to magistrates, to all
               governmental officers, to tributaries, to all the subjects of governments, to
               younger sons&#8212;defining their relation to the first born, who is called
               <em>Lord</em> and <i>ruler</i>&#8212;to prophets, to
               kings, to the Messiah, and in respectful addresses not less than
               <em>fifty</em> times in the Old Testament.

            </p>
            <p>
               If the Israelites not only held slaves, but multitudes of them, if
               Abraham had thousands and if they <em>abounded</em> under the Mosaic
               system, why had their language <em>no word</em> that
               <em>meant slave</em>? That language must be wofully poverty-stricken,
               which has no signs to represent the most common and familiar objects and
               conditions. To represent by the same word, and without figure, property, and
               the owner of that property, is a solecism. Ziba was an
               "<i>&#277;b&#277;dh</i>," yet he
               "<em>owned</em>" (!) twenty
               <i>&#277;b&#277;dhs</i>! In our
               language, we have both <em>servant</em> and <em>slave</em>. Why?
               Because we have both the <em>things</em> and need <em>signs</em>
               for them. If the tongue had a sheath, as swords have scabbards, we
               should have some <em>name</em> for it: but our dictionaries give us none.
               Why? Because there is no such <em>thing</em>. But the objector asks,
               "Would not the Israelites use their word
               <i>&#277;b&#277;dh</i> if they spoke
               of the slave of a heathen?" Answer. Their <i>national</i>
               servants or tributaries, are spoken of frequently, but domestic servants so
               rarely that no necessity existed, even if they were slaves, for coining a new
               word. Besides, the fact of their being domestics, under
               <i>heathen laws

                  and usages</i> proclaimed their <em>liabilities</em>, their
               <em>locality</em> made a <em>specific</em> term unnecessary. But if
               the Israelites had not only <em>servants</em>, but a multitude of
               <em>slaves</em>, a <em>word meaning slave</em>, would have been
               indispensable for every day convenience. Further, the laws of the Mosaic
               system were so many sentinels on the outposts to warn off foreign
               practices. The border ground of Canaan, was quarantine ground,
               enforcing the strictest non-intercourse in usages between the without
               and the within.

            <p><a name="E4r3_Lev25_44_forever"></a>
               2. "FOREVER." This is quoted to prove that servants were to
               serve during their life time, and their posterity from generation to
               generation. No such idea is contained in the passage. The word
               "forever," instead of defining the length of
               <i>individual</i> service, proclaims
               the permanence of the regulation laid down in the two verses
               preceding, namely, that their <i>permanent domestics</i>
               should be of the Strangers, and not of the Israelites: it declares the
               duration of that general provision. As if God had said, "You shall
               <em>always</em> get your <em>permanent</em> laborers from the nations
               round about you&#8212;your servants shall always be of that class of
               persons." As it stands in the original it is plain&#8212;"Forever of them
               shall ye serve yourselves." This is the literal rendering.

            </p>
            <p>
               That "<em>forever</em>" refers to the permanent relations of a
               <i>community</i>, rather than to the services of
               <i>individuals</i>, is a fair inference from the form of
               the expression, "Both thy bondmen, &amp;c., shall be of the
               <i>heathen</i>. Of THEM shall ye buy," &amp;c. "THEY
               shall be your possession." To say nothing of the uncertainty of
               <em>those individuals</em> surviving those <i>after</i> whom they are to live, the language used, applies more naturally
               to a <em>body</em> of people, than to <em>individual</em> servants.
               Besides <em>perpetual</em> service cannot be argued from the term
               <em>forever</em>. The ninth and tenth verses of the same chapter, limit
               it absolutely by the jubilee. "Then thou shalt cause the trumpet of the
               jubilee to sound * * throughout ALL your land." "And ye shall proclaim liberty
               throughout all the land unto ALL the inhabitants thereof." It may be
               objected that "inhabitants" here means <i>Israelitish</i>
               inhabitants alone. The command is, "Proclaim liberty throughout all the land
               unto ALL <em>the inhabitants thereof</em>." Besides, in the sixth verse,
               there is an enumeration of the different classes of the inhabitants, in which
               servants and Strangers are included; and in all the regulations of the
               jubilee, and the sabbatical year, the Strangers are included in the precepts,
               prohibitions, and promises. Again: the year of jubilee was

               ushered in, by the day of atonement. What did these institutions
               show forth? The day of atonement prefigured the atonement of
               Christ, and the year of jubilee, the gospel jubilee. And did they
               prefigure an atonement and a jubilee to Jews only? Were they types
               of sins remitted, and of salvation proclaimed to the nation of Israel
               alone? Is there no redemption for us Gentiles in these ends of the
               earth, and is our hope presumption and impiety? Did that old partition
               wall survive the shock, that made earth quake, and hid the sun,
               burst graves and rocks, and rent the temple veil? and did the Gospel
               only rear it higher to thunder direr perdition from its frowning battlements
               on all without? No! The God of our salvation lives
               "Good tidings of great joy shall be to ALL people." One shout shall
               swell from all the ransomed, "Thou hast redeemed us unto God by
               thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation."
               To deny that the blessings of the jubilee extended to the servants
               from the <em>Gentiles</em>, makes Christianity <em>Judaism</em>. It
               not only eclipses the glory of the Gospel, but strikes out the sun. The
               refusal to release servants at the jubilee falsified and disannulled a
               grand leading type of the atonement, and was a libel on the doctrine of
               Christ's redemption. Finally, even if <em>forever</em> did refer to
               <i>individual</i> service, we have ample precedents for
               limiting the term by the jubilee. The same word defines the length of time
               which <em>Jewish</em> servants served who did not go out in the
               <em>seventh</em> year. And all admit that they went out at the jubilee.
               Ex. xxi. 2-6; Deut. xv. 12-17. The 23d verse of the same chapter is quoted to
               prove that "<em>forever</em>" in the 46th verse, extends beyond the
               jubilee. "The land shall not be sold FOREVER, for the land is mine"&#8212;since it
               would hardly be used in different senses in the same general connection. As
               <em>forever</em>, in the 46th verse, respects the <em>general
                  arrangement</em>, and not <i>individual service</i> the
               objection does not touch the argument. Besides in the 46th verse,
               the word used, is <i>Ol&#257;m</i>,
               meaning <em>throughout the period</em>, whatever that may be. Whereas in

               3. "INHERITANCE AND POSSESSION," "Ye shall take them as an
               INHERITANCE for your children after you to inherit them for a possession."
               This refers to the <em>nations</em>, and not to the
               <i>individual</i> servants, procured from these nations.
               We have already shown, that servants could not be held as a
               <i>property</i>-possession, and inheritance; that they
               became servants of their <em>own accord</em>, and were paid wages; that
               they

               were released by law from their regular labor nearly <em>half the days in
                  each year</em>, and thoroughly <em>instructed</em>; that the servants
               were <em>protected</em> in all their personal, social and religious
               rights, equally with their masters &amp;c. All remaining, after these ample
               reservations, would be small temptation, either to the lust of power or of
               lucre; a profitable "possession" and "inheritance," truly! What if our
               American slaves were all placed in <em>just such a condition</em> Alas,
               for that soft, melodious circumlocution, "Our PECULIAR species of property!"
               Verily, emphasis would be cadence, and euphony and irony
               meet together!  What eager snatches at mere words, and bald technics,
               irrespective of connection, principles of construction, Bible
               usages, or limitations of meaning by other passages&#8212;and all to eke
               out such a sense as sanctifies existing usages, thus making God
               pander for lust. The words <i>nahal</i>
               and <i>nahala</i>, inherit and inheritance
               by no means necessarily signify <em>articles of property</em>. "The
               people answered the king and said, we have none
               <i>inheritance</i> in the son of Jesse." 2 Chron. x. 16.
               Did they moan gravely to disclaim the holding of their kin; as an article of
               <em>property</em>? "Children are an <em>heritage</em> (inheritance)
               of the Lord." Ps. cxxvii. 3. "Pardon our iniquity, and take us for thine
               <em>inheritance</em>." Ex. xxxiv. 9. When God pardons his enemies, and
               adopts them as children, does he make them <i>articles of
                  property</i>? Are forgiveness, and chattel-making, synonymes? "Thy
               testimonies have I taken as a <i>heritage</i>"
               (inheritance.) Ps. cxix. 111. "<em>I</em> am their
               <i>inheritance</i>." Ezek. xliv. 28. "I will give thee
               the heathen for thine <i>inheritance</i>." Ps. ii. 8.
               "For the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his
               <i>inheritance</i>." Ps. xciv 14. see also Deut. iv. 20;
               Josh. xiii. 33; Ps. lxxxii. 8; lxxviii. 62, 71; Prov. xiv. 8. The question
               whether the servants were a PROPERTY-"<i>possession</i>,"
               has been already discussed&#8212;pp. 37-46&#8212;we need add in this place but a
               word, <i>&#257;huzz&#257;</i>
               rendered "<em>possession</em>." "And Joseph placed his father and his
               brethren, and gave them a <i>possession</i> in the land of
               Egypt." Gen. xlii. 11. In what sense was Goshen the
               <i>possession</i> of the Israelites? Answer, in the sense
               of <em>having it to live in</em>. In what sense were the Israelites to
               <i>possess</i> these nations, and <em>take them</em>
               as an <em>inheritance for their children</em>? Answer, they possessed
               them as a permanent source of supply for domestic or household servants.
               And this relation to these nations was to go down to posterity
               as a standing regulation, having the certainty and regularity of a descent

               by inheritance. The sense of the whole regulation may be
               given thus: "Thy permanent domestics, which thou shalt have, shall
               be of the nations that are round about you, of <em>them</em> shall ye get
               male and female domestics." "Moreover of the children of the foreigners
               that do sojourn among you, of <em>them</em> shall ye get, and of their
               families that are with you, which they begat in your land, and
               <em>they</em> shall be your permanent resource." "And ye shall take them
               as a <em>perpetual</em> provision for your children after you, to hold as
               a <em>constant source of supply</em>. Always <em>of them</em> shall ye
               serve yourselves." The design of the passage is manifest from its structure.
               It was to point out the <em>class</em> of persons from which they were to
               get their supply of servants, and the <em>way</em> in which they were to
               get them.

               As only <em>one</em> class is called "<i>hired</i>,"
               it is inferred that servants of the <em>other</em> class were
               <em>not paid</em> for their labor. That God, with thundering
               anathemas against those who "used their neighbor's service
               without wages," granted a special indulgence to his chosen people
               to force others to work, and rob them of earnings, provided always,
               in selecting their victims, they spared "the gentlemen of property
               and standing," and pounced only upon the strangers and the common
               people. The inference that "<em>hired</em>" is synonymous with
               <em>paid</em>, and that those servants not <em>called</em> "hired"
               were not <em>paid</em> for their labor, is a mere assumption. The meaning
               of the English verb <i>to hire</i>, is to procure for a
               <i>temporary</i> use at a certain price&#8212;to engage
               a person to temporary service for wages. That is also the meaning of the
               Hebrew word "<i>saukar</i>." It is not
               used when the procurement of <i>permanent</i> service is
               spoken of. Now, we ask, would <i>permanent</i> servants,
               those who constituted a stationary part of the family, have been designated
               by the same term that marks <i>temporary</i> servants?
               The every-day distinction on this subject, are familiar as table-talk. In
               many families the domestics perform only the <em>regular</em> work.
               Whatever is occasional merely, as the washing of a family, is done by persons
               hired expressly for the purpose. The familiar distinction between the two
               classes, is "servants," and "hired help," (not <i>paid</i>
               help.) <em>Both classes are paid</em>. One is permanent,

               the other occasional and temporary, and therefore in this case
               called "<i>hired</i><a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN22"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN22"></a>."

            <p><a name="NoteE4r3_FN22"></a><a href="#FootE4r3_FN22">A</a>: To suppose
               a servant robbed of his earnings because he is not called a
               <i>hired</i> servant is profound induction! If I employ
               a man at twelve dollars a month to work my farm, he is my
               "<i>hired</i>" man, but if <em>I give him such a portion
                  of the crop</em>, or in other words, if he works my farm
               "<i>on shares</i>," every farmer knows that he is no
               longer called my "<i>hired</i>" man. Yet he works the
               same farm, in the same way, at the same time, and with the same teams and
               tools; and does the same amount of work in the year, and perhaps earns twenty
               dollars a month, instead of twelve. Now as he is no longer called
               "<i>hired</i>," and as he still works my farm, suppose my
               neighbours sagely infer, that since he is not my
               "<i>hired</i>" laborer, I <em>rob</em> him of his
               earnings and with all the gravity of owls, pronounce the oracular decision,
               and hoot it abroad. My neighbors are deep divers!&#8212;like some theological
               professors, they not only go to the bottom but come up covered with the
               tokens.

               A variety of particulars are recorded distinguishing
               <i>hired</i> from <i>bought</i>
               servants. (1.) Hired servants were paid daily at
               the close of their work. Lev. xix 13; Deut. xxiv. 14, 15; Job. vii.
               2; Matt. xx. 8. "<i>Bought</i>" servants were paid in
               advance, (a reason for their being called <i>bought</i>,)
               and those that went out at the seventh year received a
               <i>gratuity</i>. Deut. xv. 12, 13. (2.) The "hired"
               were paid <em>in money</em>, the "bought" received their
               <i>gratuity</i>, at least, in grain, cattle, and the
               product of the vintage. Deut. xiv. 17. (3.) The "hired"
               <em>lived</em> in their own families, the "bought" were part of their
               masters' families. (4.) The "hired" supported their families out of their
               wages: the "bought" and their families were supported by the master
               <em>besides</em> their wages. The "bought" servants were,
               <em>as a class, superior to the hired</em>&#8212;were more trust-worthy,
               had greater privileges, and occupied a higher station in society. (1.)
               They were intimately incorporated with the family of the masters,
               were guests at family festivals, and social solemnities, from which
               hired servants were excluded. Lev. xxii. 10; Ex. xii, 43, 45. (2.)
               Their interests were far more identified with those of their masters'
               family. They were often, actually or prospectively, heirs of their
               masters' estates, as in the case of Eliezer, of Ziba, and the sons of
               Bilhah and Zilpah. When there were no sons, or when they were
               unworthy, bought servants were made heirs. Prov. xvii. 2. We
               find traces of this usage in the New Testament. "But when the
               husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, this
               is the <i>heir</i>, come let us kill him,
               <em>that the inheritance may be ours.</em>" Luke xx. 14. In
               no instance does a <i>hired</i> servant inherit his
               master's estate. (3.) Marriages took place between servants and their
               master's daughters. Sheshan had a <em>servant</em>, an Egyptian, whose

               name was Jarha. And Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant
               to wife. 1 Chron. ii. 34, 35. There is no instance of a
               <i>hired</i> servant forming such an alliance. (4.) Bought
               servants and their descendants were treated with the same affection and
               respect as the other members of the family.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN23"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN23"></a>. The treatment of Abraham's servants,
               Gen. xxv.&#8212;the intercourse between Gideon and his servant, Judg.
               vii. 10, 11; Saul and his servant, 1 Sam. iv. 5, 22; Jonathan and
               his servant, 1 Sam. xiv. 1-14, and Elisha and his servant, are illustrations.
               No such tie seems to have existed between <i>hired</i>
               servants and their masters. Their untrustworthiness was proverbial. John
               ix. 12, 13. None but the <em>lowest class</em> engaged as hired servants,
               and the kinds of labor assigned to them required little knowledge and
               skill. Various passages show the low repute and trifling character
               of the class from which they were hired. Judg. ix. 4; 1 Sam. ii. 5.
               The superior condition of bought servants is manifest in the high
               trusts confided to them, and in their dignity and authority in the
               household. In no instance is a <i>hired</i> servant thus
               distinguished. The <i>bought</i> servant is manifestly the
               master's representative in the family&#8212;with plenipotentiary powers over
               adult children, even negotiating marriage for them. Abraham adjured his
               servant not to take a wife for Isaac of the daughters of the Canaanites. The
               servant himself selected the individual. Servants also exercised discretionary
               power in the management of their masters' estates, "And the servant
               took ten camels of the camels of his master, <em>for all the goods of his
                  master were under his hand</em>." Gen. xxiv. 10. The reason assigned for
               taking them, is not that such was Abraham's direction, but that the servant
               had discretionary control. Servants had also discretionary power in the
               <em>disposal of property</em>. See Gen. xxiv. 22, 23, 53. The condition
               of Ziba in the house of Mephibosheth, is a case in point. So
               in Prov. xvii. 2. Distinct traces of this estimation are to be found in
               the New Testament, Matt. xxiv. 45; Luke xii, 42, 44. So in the
               parable of the talents; the master seems to have set up each of his
               servants in trade with a large capital. The unjust steward had large
               <em>discretionary</em> power, was "accused of wasting his master's goods,"
               and manifestly regulated with his debtors, the <em>terms</em> of
               settlement. Luke xvi. 4-8. Such trusts were never reposed in
               <i>hired</i> servants.

               The inferior condition of <i>hired</i> servants, is
               illustrated in the parable of the prodigal son. When the prodigal, perishing
               with hunger among the swine and husks, came to himself, his proud heart
               broke; "I will arise," he cried, "and go to my father." And then
               to assure his father of the depth of his humility, resolved to add,
               "Make me as one of thy <i>hired</i> servants." If
               <i>hired</i> servants were the <em>superior</em>
               class&#8212;to apply for the situation, savored little of that
               sense of unworthiness that seeks the dust with hidden face, and
               cries "unclean." Unhumbled nature <em>climbs</em>; or if it falls, clings
               fast, where first it may. Humility sinks of its own weight, and in
               the lowest deep, digs lower. The design of the parable was to illustrate
               on the one hand, the joy of God, as he beholds afar off, the
               returning sinner "seeking an injured father's face" who runs to clasp
               and bless him with unchiding welcome; and on the other, the
               contrition of the penitent, turning homeward with tears from his
               wanderings, his stricken spirit breaking with its ill-desert he sobs
               aloud. "The lowest place, <em>the lowest place</em>, I can abide no
               other." Or in those inimitable words, "Father I have sinned against Heaven,
               and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son; make
               me as one of thy HIRED servants." The supposition that
               <i>hired</i> servants were the <em>highest</em> class,
               takes from the parable an element of winning beauty and pathos. It is manifest
               to every careful student of the Bible, that <em>one</em> class of
               servants, was on terms of equality with the children and other members of the
               family. (Hence the force of Paul's declaration, Gal. iv. 1, "Now I say unto
               you, that the heir, so long as he is a child, DIFFERETH NOTHING FROM A
               SERVANT, though he be lord of all.") If this were the
               <i>hired</i> class, the prodigal was a sorry specimen of
               humility. Would our Lord have put such language upon the lips of one held up
               by himself, as a model of gospel humility, to illustrate its deep sense of an
               ill-desert? If this is <em>humility</em>, put it on stilts, and set it a
               strutting, while pride takes lessons, and blunders in apeing it.

               Israelites and Strangers, belonged indiscriminately to <em>each</em> class
               of the servants, the <i>bought</i> and the
               <i>hired</i>. That those in the former

               <em>Israelites</em>, were more favored than even the bought servants from
               the <em>Strangers</em>. No one from the Strangers, however wealthy or
               highly endowed, was eligible to the highest office, nor could he own the soil.
               This last disability seems to have been one reason for the different periods
               of service required of the two classes of bought servants&#8212;the Israelites
               and the Strangers. The Israelite was to serve six years&#8212;the Stranger
               until the jubilee. As the Strangers could not own the soil, nor even
               houses, except within walled towns, most would attach themselves
               to Israelitish families. <a name="E4r3_Lev25_39_Isrserv"></a>Those who were wealthy, or skilled in manufactures,
               instead of becoming servants would need servants for their
               own use, and as inducements for the Stranger's to become servants to
               the Israelites, were greater than persons of their own nation could hold
               out to them, these wealthy Strangers would naturally procure the poorer
               Israelites for servants. Lev. xxv. 47. In a word, such was the
               political condition of the Strangers, that the Jewish polity offered a
               virtual bounty, to such as would become permanent servants, and thus
               secure those privileges already enumerated, and for their children in
               the second generation a permanent inheritance. Ezek. xlvii. 21-23.
               None but the monied aristocracy would be likely to decline such offers.
               On the other hand, the Israelites, owning all the soil, and an inheritance
               of land being a sacred possession, to hold it free of incumbrance
               was with every Israelite, a delicate point, both of family honor
               and personal character. 1 Kings xxi. 3. Hence, to forego the control
               of one's inheritance, after the division of the paternal domain, or to
               be kept out of it after having acceded to it, was a burden grievous to
               be borne. <a name="E4r3_Lev25_39_reas7yr"></a>To mitigate as much as possible such a calamity, the law
               released the Israelitish servant at the end of six
               years<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN24"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN24"></a>; as, during
               that time&#8212;if of the first class&#8212;the partition of the patrimonial
               land might have taken place; or, if of the second, enough money might
               have been earned to disencumber his estate, and thus he might assume
               his station as a lord of the soil. If neither contingency had

               occurred, then after another six years the opportunity was again offered,
               and so on, until the jubilee. <a name="E4r3_Lev25_39_lngreas"></a>So while
               strong motives urged the Israelite to discontinue his service as soon as the
               exigency had passed which made him a servant, every consideration impelled the
               <i>Stranger</i> to <em>prolong</em> his term of
               service; and the same kindness which
               dictated the law of six years' service for the Israelite, assigned as
               a general rule, a much longer period to the Gentile servant, who
               had every inducement to protract the term. It should be borne in
               mind, that adult Jews ordinarily became servants, only as a temporary
               expedient to relieve themselves from embarrassment, and
               ceased to be such when that object was effected. The poverty that
               forced them to it was a calamity, and their service was either a means
               of relief, or a measure of prevention; not pursued as a permanent
               business, but resorted to on emergencies&#8212;a sort of episode in the
               main scope of their lives. Whereas with the Strangers, it was a
               <i>permanent employment</i>, pursued both as a
               <em>means</em> of bettering their own condition, and that of their
               posterity, and as an <em>end</em> for its own sake, conferring
               on them privileges, and a social estimation not otherwise attainable.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r3_FN24"></a><a href="#FootE4r3_FN24">A</a>: Another reason for protracting the service
               until the seventh year, seems to have been the coincidence of that period
               with other arrangements, in the Jewish economy. Its pecuniary
               responsibilities, social relations, and general internal structure, were
               <em>graduated</em> upon a septennial scale. Besides as those Israelites
               who became servants through poverty, would not sell themselves, till other
               expedients to recruit their finances had
               failed&#8212;(Lev. xxv. 35)&#8212;their <em>becoming servants</em>
               proclaimed such a state of their affairs, as demanded the labor of a
               <em>course of years</em> fully to reinstate them.

               We see from the foregoing, why servants purchased from the
               heathen, are called by way of distinction, <em>the</em> servants, (not
               <i>bondmen</i>,) (1.) They followed it as a
               <i>permanent business</i>. (2.) Their term of service was
               <em>much longer</em> than that of the other class. (3.) As a class they
               doubtless greatly outnumbered the Israelitish servants. (4.) All the
               Strangers that dwelt in the land were <i>tributaries</i>,
               required to pay an annual tax to the government, either in money, or in public
               service, (called a "<i>tribute of land-service</i>;") in
               other words, all the Strangers were <i>national
                  servants</i> to the Israelites, and the same Hebrew word used to designate
               <i>individual</i> servants, equally designates
               <i>national</i> servants or tributaries. 2 Sam. viii. 2,
               6, 14. 2 Chron. viii. 7-9. Deut xx. 11. 2 Sam. x. 19. 1 Kings ix. 21, 22.
               1 Kings iv. 21. Gen. xxvii. 29. The same word is applied to the Israelites,
               when they paid tribute to other nations. 2 Kings xvii. 3.
               Judg. iii. 8, 14. Gen. xlix. 15. <a name="E4r3_Lev25_39_dsrv"></a>Another
               distinction between the Jewish and Gentile bought servants, was in their
               <em>kinds</em> of service. The servants from the Strangers were properly
               the <i>domestics</i>, or household servants, employed in
               all family work, in offices of personal attendance, and in such mechanical
               labor, as was required by increasing wants, and needed repairs. The Jewish
               bought servants seem almost exclusively
               <i>agricultural</i>. Besides being better fitted for

               it by previous habits&#8212;agriculture, and the tending of cattle, were
               regarded by the Israelites as the most honorable of all occupations.
               After Saul was elected king, and escorted to Gibeah, the next report
               of him is, "<em>And behold Saul came after the herd out of the
                  field</em>." 1 Sam. xi. 7. Elisha "was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen."
               1 Kings xix. 19. King Uzziah "loved husbandry." 2 Chron. xxvi.
               10. Gideon <em>was "threshing wheat</em>" when called to lead the host
               against the Midianites. Judg. vi. 11. The superior honorableness of
               agriculture, is shown, in that it was protected and supported by the
               fundamental law of the theocracy&#8212;God indicating it as the chief prop
               of the government. The Israelites were like permanent fixtures on
               their soil, so did they cling to it. To be agriculturalists on their own
               inheritances, was with them the grand claim to honorable estimation.
               Agriculture being pre-eminently a <em>Jewish</em> employment, to assign a
               native Israelite to other employments as a business, was to break up
               his habits, do violence to cherished predilections, and put him to a
               kind of labor in which he had no skill, and which he deemed
               degrading. In short, it was in the earlier ages of the Mosaic system,
               practically to <i>unjew</i> him, a hardship and rigor
               grievous to be borne, as it annihilated a visible distinction between the
               descendants of Abraham and the Strangers.&#8212;<em>To guard this and
                  another fundamental distinction</em>, God instituted the regulation which
               stands at the head of this branch of our inquiry, "If thy brother that
               dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee, thou shalt not compel
               him to serve as a bond-servant." In other words, thou shalt not put him to
               servant's work&#8212;to the business, and into the condition of domestics.
               In the Persian version it is translated thus, "Thou shalt not assign
               to him the work of <i>servitude</i>." In the Septuagint,
               "He shall not serve thee with the service of a
               <i>domestic</i>." In the Syriac, "Thou shalt not employ
               him after the manner of servants." In the Samaritan, "Thou shalt not require
               him to serve in the service of a servant." In the Targum of Onkelos, "He
               shall not serve thee with the service of a household servant." In the Targum
               of Jonathan, "Thou shalt not cause him to serve according to the usages of the
               servitude of servants."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN25"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN25"></a> The meaning of the passage
               is, <em>thou shalt

                  not assign him to the same grade, nor put him to the same service,
                  with permanent domestics.</em> The remainder of the regulation
               is,&#8212;"<em>But as an hired servant and as a sojourner shall he be with
                  thee.</em>" Hired servants were not incorporated into the families of their
               masters: they still retained their own family organization, without the
               surrender of any domestic privilege, honor, or authority; and this
               even though they resided under the same roof with their master.
               While bought servants were associated with their master's families at
               meals, at the Passover, and at other family festivals, hired servants
               and sojourners were not. Ex. xii. 44, 45; Lev. xxii. 10, 11. Hired
               servants were not subject to the authority of their masters in any such
               sense as the master's wife, children, and bought servants. Hence
               the only form of oppressing hired servants spoken of in the Scriptures
               as practicable to masters, is that <em>of keeping back their wages</em>.
               To have taken away such privileges in the case under consideration,
               would have been pre-eminent "<em>rigor</em>," for it was not a servant
               born in the house of a master, not a minor, whose minority had been sold by
               the father, neither was it one who had not yet acceded to his inheritance:
               nor finally, one who had received the <i>assignment</i>
               of his inheritance, but was working off from it an incumbrance, before
               entering upon its possession and control. But it was that of
               <em>the head of a family</em>, who had known better days, now reduced to
               poverty, forced to relinquish the loved inheritance of his fathers, with the
               competence and respectful consideration its possession secured to him, and
               to be indebted to a neighbor for shelter, sustenance, and employment.
               So sad a reverse, might well claim sympathy; but one consolation
               cheers him in the house of his pilgrimage; he is an
               <i>Israelite&#8212;Abraham is his father</i>, and now in
               his calamity he clings closer than ever, to the distinction conferred by his
               birth-right. To rob him of this, were "the unkindest cut of all." To have
               assigned him to a grade of service filled only by those whose permanent
               business was serving, would have been to "rule over him with" peculiar
               "rigor." "Thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bond-servant," or literally,
               <em>thou shalt not serve thyself with him, with the service of a
                  servant</em>, guaranties his political privileges, and a kind and grade of
               service, comporting with his character and relations as an Israelite. And
               "as a <i>hired</i> servant, and as a sojourner shall he
               be with thee," secures to him his family organization, the respect and
               authority due to its head, and the general consideration resulting from such
               a station. Being already in possession of his inheritance, and the head of a
               household, the law

               so arranged the conditions of his service as to <em>alleviate</em> as
               much as possible the calamity, which had reduced him from independence and
               authority, to penury and subjection. The import of the command
               which concludes this topic in the forty-third verse, ("Thou shalt not
               rule over him with rigor,") is manifestly this, you shall not disregard
               those differences in previous associations, station, authority, and
               political privileges, upon which this regulation is based; for to hold
               this class of servants <em>irrespective</em> of these distinctions, and
               annihilating them, is to "rule with rigor." The same command is repeated in
               the forty-sixth verse, and applied to the distinction between servants of
               Jewish, and those of Gentile extraction, and forbids the overlooking
               of distinctive Jewish peculiarities, the disregard of which would be
               <em>rigorous</em> in the extreme<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN26"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN26"></a>. The construction commonly put upon the
               phrase "rule with rigor," and the inference drawn from it, have an air
               vastly oracular. It is interpreted to mean, "you shall not make him
               a chattel, and strip him of legal protection, nor force him to work
               without pay." The inference is like unto it, viz., since the command
               forbade such outrages upon the Israelites, it permitted and commissioned
               their infliction upon the Strangers. Such impious and
               shallow smattering captivates scoffers and libertines; its flippancy and
               blasphemy, and the strong scent of its loose-reined license works
               like a charm upon them. What boots it to reason against such rampant
               affinities! In Ex. i. 13, it is said that the Egyptians "made the
               children of Israel to <em>serve</em> with rigor." This rigor is affirmed
               of the <em>amount of labor</em> extorted and the <em>mode</em> of the
               exaction. The expression, "serve with rigor," is never applied to the service
               of servants under the Mosaic system. The phrase, "thou shalt not RULE over
               him with rigor," does not prohibit unreasonable exactions of labor,
               nor inflictions of cruelty. Such were provided against otherwise.
               But it forbids confounding the distinctions between a Jew and a
               Stranger, by assigning the former to the same grade of service, for
               the same term of time, and under the same political disabilities as
               the latter.

               shall not compel him to serve as a bond-servant" is, "The Hebrew servant is
               not to be required to do any thing which is accounted degrading&#8212;such as
               all offices of personal attendance, as loosing his master's shoe-latchet,
               bringing him water to wash his feet and hands, waiting on him at table,
               dressing him, carrying things to and from the bath. The Hebrew servant is to
               work with his master as a son or brother, in the business of his farm, or

            <p>
               We are now prepared to review at a glance, the condition of the

               different classes of servants, with the modifications peculiar to each
               class. In the possession of all fundamental rights, all classes of
               servants were on an absolute equality, all were equally protected by
               law in their persons, character, property and social relations; all
               were voluntary, all were compensated for their labor, and released
               from it nearly half of the days in each year; all were furnished
               with stated instruction: none in either class were in any sense articles
               of property, all were regarded as <i>men</i>, with the
               rights, interests, hopes and destinies of <i>men</i>. In
               all these respects, <em>all</em> classes of servants among the Israelites,
               formed but ONE CLASS. The <em>different</em> classes and the differences
               in <em>each</em> class, were, (1.) <em>Hired Servants.</em>
               This class consisted both of Israelites and Strangers. Their employments
               were different. The <i>Israelite</i> was an agricultural
               servant. The Stranger was a <i>domestic</i> and
               <i>personal</i> servant, and in some instances
               <i>mechanical</i>; both were occasional and temporary.
               Both lived in their own families, their wages were <em>money</em>, and
               they were paid when their work was done.
               (2.) <i>Bought Servants</i>, (including those "born in the
               house.") This class also, consisted of Israelites and Strangers, the same
               difference in their kinds of employments noticed before. Both were paid in
               advance<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN27"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN27"></a>, and neither
               was temporary. The Israelitish servant, with the exception of the
               <i>freeholders</i> was released after six years. The
               stranger was a permanent servant, continuing until the jubilee. A marked
               distinction obtained also between different classes of <em>Jewish</em>
               bought servants. Ordinarily, they were merged in their master's family, and,
               like his wife and children, subject to his authority; (and, like them,
               protected by law from its abuse.) But the
               <i>freeholder</i> was a marked exception: his family
               relations, and authority remained unaffected, nor was he subjected as an
               inferior to the control of his master, though dependent upon him for
               employment.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r3_FN27"></a><a href="#FootE4r3_FN27">A</a>: The payment <em>in advance</em>,
               doubtless lessened the price of the purchase; the servant thus having the use
               of the money, and the master assuming all the risks of life and health for
               labor: at the expiration of the six year's contract, the master having
               suffered no loss from the risk incurred at the making of it, was obliged by
               law to release the servant with a liberal gratuity. The reason assigned for
               this is, "he hath been worth a double hired servant unto thee in serving thee
               six years," as if it had been said, as you have experienced no loss from the
               risks of life, and ability to labor, incurred in the purchase, and which
               lessened the price, and as, by being your servant for six years, he has saved
               you the time and trouble of looking up and hiring laborers on emergencies,
               therefore, "thou shalt furnish him liberally," &amp;c.
            </p>
            <p>
               It should be kept in mind, that <em>both</em> classes of servants, the
               Israelite and the Stranger, not only enjoyed <em>equal natural and religious
                  rights</em>, but <em>all the civil and political privileges</em>
               enjoyed by those of their own people who were <em>not</em> servants. They
               also shared in common with them the political disabilities which appertained
               to all Strangers, whether the servants of Jewish masters, or the masters of
               Jewish servants. Further, the disabilities of the servants from the Strangers
               were exclusively <i>political</i> and
               <i>national.</i> (1.) They, in common with all Strangers,
               could not own the soil. (2.) They were ineligible to civil offices. (3.) They
               were assigned to employments less honorable than those in which Israelitish
               servants engaged; agriculture being regarded as fundamental to the existence
               of the state, other employments were in less repute, and deemed
               <i>unjewish.</i></p>
            <p><a name="E4r3_review_pol"></a>
               Finally, the Strangers, whether servants or masters, were all
               protected equally with the descendants of Abraham. In respect to
               political privileges, their condition was much like that of naturalized
               foreigners in the United States; whatever their wealth or intelligence,
               or moral principle, or love for our institutions, they can neither
               go to the ballot-box, nor own the soil, nor be eligible to office. Let
               a native American, be suddenly bereft of these privilege, and loaded
               with the disabilities of an alien, and what to the foreigner would
               be a light matter, to <em>him</em>, would be the severity of
               <em>rigor</em>. The recent condition of the Jews and Catholics in England,
               is another illustration. Rothschild, the late banker, though the richest
               private citizen in the world, and perhaps master of scores of English
               servants, who sued for the smallest crumbs of his favor, was, as a subject of
               the government, inferior to the lowest among them. Suppose an
               Englishman of the Established Church, were by law deprived of power to own
               the soil, of eligibility to office and of the electoral franchise,
               would Englishmen think it a misapplication of language, if it
               were said, the government "rules over him with rigor?" And yet
               his person, property, reputation, conscience, all his social relations,
               the disposal of his time, the right of locomotion at pleasure, and of
               natural liberty in all respects, are just as much protected by law as
               the Lord Chancellor's.

            <p>
               FINALLY,&#8212;As the Mosaic system was a great compound type,
               rife with meaning in doctrine and duty; the practical power of the
               whole, depended upon the exact observance of those distinctions and
               relations which constituted its significancy. Hence, the care to preserve

               serve inviolate the distinction between a <em>descendant of Abraham</em>
               and a <em>Stranger</em>, even when the Stranger was a proselyte, had gone
               through the initiatory ordinances, entered the congregation, and become
               incorporated with the Israelites by family alliance. The regulation
               laid down in Ex. xxi. 2-6, is an illustration. In this case, the
               Israelitish servant, whose term expired in six years, married one
               of his master's <i>permanent female domestics</i>; but
               her marriage, did not release her master from <em>his</em> part of the
               contract for her whole term of service, nor from his legal obligation to
               support and educate her children. Neither did it do away that distinction,
               which marked her national descent by a specific
               <em>grade</em> and <em>term</em> of service, nor impair
               her obligation to fulfill <em>her</em> part of the contract. Her relations
               as a permanent domestic grew out of a distinction guarded with great care
               throughout the Mosaic system. To render it void, would have been
               to divide the system against itself. This God would not tolerate.
               Nor, on the other hand, would he permit the master, to throw off the
               responsibility of instructing her children, nor the care and expense of
               their helpless infancy and rearing. He was bound to support and
               educate them, and all her children born afterwards during her term of
               service. The whole arrangement beautifully illustrates that wise and
               tender regard for the interests of all the parties concerned, which
               arrays the Mosaic system in robes of glory, and causes it to shine as
               the sun in the kingdom of our Father. By this law, the children had
               secured to them a mother's tender care. If the husband loved his
               wife and children, he could compel his master to keep him, whether
               he had any occasion for his services or not. If he did not love them,
               to be rid of him was a blessing; and in that case, the regulation
               would prove an act for the relief of an afflicted family. It is not by
               any means to be inferred, that the release of the servant in the
               seventh year, either absolved him from the obligations of marriage,
               or shut him out from the society of his family. He could
               doubtless procure a service at no great distance from them, and might
               often do it, to get higher wages, or a kind of employment better suited
               to his taste and skill. The great number of days on which the
               law released servants from regular labor, would enable him to spend
               much more time with his family, than can be spent by most of the
               agents of our benevolent societies with <em>their</em> families, or by
               many merchants, editors, artists &amp;c., whose daily business is in New York,
               while their families reside from ten to one hundred miles in the country.

            <p>
               We conclude this Inquiry by touching briefly upon an objection,
               which, though not formally stated, has been already set aside by the
               whole tenor of the foregoing argument. It is this,&#8212;"The slavery
               of the Canaanites by the Israelites, was appointed by God as a commutation
               of the punishment of death denounced against them for their
               sins." If the absurdity of a sentence consigning persons to
               <em>death</em>, and at the same time to perpetual <em>slavery</em>,
               did not sufficiently laugh at itself, it would be small self-denial, in a
               case so tempting, to make up the deficiency by a general contribution. For,
               <em>be it remembered</em>, only <em>one</em> statute was ever given
               respecting the disposition to be made of the inhabitants of Canaan. If the
               sentence of death was pronounced against them, and afterwards
               <em>commuted</em>, when? where? by whom? and in what terms was the
               commutation, and where is it recorded? Grant, for argument's sake, that all
               the Canaanites were sentenced to unconditional extermination; as there was no
               reversal of the sentence, how can a right to <em>enslave</em> them, be
               drawn from such premises? The punishment of death is one of the highest
               recognitions of man's moral nature possible. It proclaims him
               <em>man</em>&#8212;rational, accountable, guilty, deserving
               death for having done his utmost to cheapen
               human life, when the proof of its priceless worth lived in his own
               nature. But to make him a <i>slave</i>, cheapens to
               nothing <i>universal human nature</i>, and instead of
               healing a wound, gives a death-stab. What! repair an injury to rational being
               in the robbery of <em>one</em> of its rights, by robbing it of
               <em>all</em>, and annihilating their <em>foundation</em>&#8212;the
               everlasting distinction between persons and things? To make a
               man a chattel, is not the <em>punishment</em>, but the
               <em>annihilation</em> of a <i>human</i>
               being, and, so far as it goes, of <em>all</em> human beings. This
               commutation of the punishment of death, into perpetual slavery, what a
               fortunate discovery! Alas! for the honor of Deity, if commentators had
               not manned the forlorn hope, and by a timely movement rescued the
               Divine character, at the very crisis of its fate, from the perilous position
               in which inspiration had carelessly left it! Here a question arises
               of sufficient importance for a separate dissertation; but must for the
               present be disposed of in a few paragraphs. WERE THE CANAANITES
               SENTENCED BY GOD TO INDIVIDUAL AND UNCONDITIONAL EXTERMINATION?
               As the limits of this inquiry forbid our giving all the
               grounds of dissent from commonly received opinions, the suggestions
               made, will be thrown out merely as QUERIES, rather than laid down
               as <i>doctrines</i>. The directions as to the disposal of
               the Canaanites,

               are mainly in the following passages: Ex. xxiii. 23-33; xxxiv. 11;
               Deut. vii. 16-25; ix. 3; xxxi. 3-5. In these verses, the Israelites
               are commanded to "destroy the Canaanites," "drive out," "consume,"
               "utterly overthrow," "put out," "dispossess them," &amp;c. Did
               these commands enjoin the unconditional and universal destruction
               of the <em>inhabitants</em> or merely of the <em>body politic?</em>
               The word <i>h&#257;r&#259;m</i>,
               to destroy, signifies <i>national</i>, as well as
               individual destruction, the destruction of
               <i>political</i> existence, equally with
               <i>personal</i>; of governmental
               organization, equally with the lives of the subjects. Besides,
               if we interpret the words destroy, consume, overthrow, &amp;c., to mean
               <i>personal</i> destruction, what meaning shall we give to
               the expressions, "throw out before thee;" "cast out before thee;" "expel,"
               "put out," "dispossess," &amp;c., which are used in the same passages? "I will
               destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all
               thine enemies <em>turn their backs unto thee</em>" Ex. xxiii. 27. Here
               "<em>all thine enemies</em>" were to <em>turn their backs</em> and
               "<em>all the people</em>" to be "<em>destroyed</em>." Does this mean
               that God would let all their <em>enemies</em> escape, but kill all their
               <em>friends</em>, or that he would <em>first</em> kill "all the
               people" and THEN make them "turn their backs," an army of runaway
               corpses? If these commands required the destruction of all
               the inhabitants, the Mosaic law was at war with itself, for directions
               as to the treatment of native residents form a large part of it. See
               Lev. xix. 34; xxv. 35, 36; xx. 22. Ex. xxiii. 9; xxii. 21; Deut.
               i. 16, 17; x. 17, 19, xxvii. 19. We find, also that provision was
               made for them in the cities of refuge. Num. xxxv. 15;&#8212;the gleanings
               of the harvest and vintage were theirs, Lev. xix. 9, 10; xxiii.
               22;&#8212;the blessings of the Sabbath, Ex. xx. 10;&#8212;the privilege of
               offering sacrifices secured, Lev. xxii. 18; and stated religious instruction
               provided for them, Deut. xxxi. 9, 12. Now does this same
               law require the <em>individual extermination</em> of those whose lives
               and interests it thus protects? These laws were given to the Israelites,
               long <em>before</em> they entered Canaan; and they must have inferred from
               them that a multitude of the inhabitants of the land were to
               <em>continue</em> in it, under their government. Again Joshua was selected
               as the leader of Israel to execute God's threatenings upon Canaan. He
               had no <i>discretionary</i> power. God's commands were
               his <em>official instructions</em>. Going beyond them would have been
               usurpation; refusing to carry them out rebellion and treason. Saul was
               rejected from being king for disobeying god's commands in a
               <em>single</em> instance. Now, if

               God commanded the individual destruction of all the Canaanites.
               Joshua <em>disobeyed him in every instance</em>. For at his death, the
               Israelites still "<em>dwelt among them</em>," and each nation is mentioned
               by name. Judg. i. 5, and yet we are told that Joshua "left nothing undone
               of all that the Lord commanded Moses;" and that he "took all that land."
               Josh. xi. 15-22. Also, that "there <em>stood not a man</em> of
               <em>all</em> their enemies before them." How can this be, if the command
               to <em>destroy</em> enjoined <i>individual</i>
               extermination, and the command to <em>drive out</em>, unconditional
               expulsion from the country, rather than their expulsion from the
               <i>possession</i> or <i>ownership</i>
               of it, as the lords of the soil? True, multitudes of the Canaanites were
               slain, but not a case can be found in which one was either killed or expelled
               who <em>acquiesced</em> in the transfer of the territory, and its
               sovereignty, from the inhabitants of the land to the Israelites. Witness the
               case of Rahab and her kindred, and the
               Gibeonites<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN28"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN28"></a>. The Canaanites knew of the miracles wrought for the
               Israelites; and that their land had been transferred to them as a judgment
               for their sins. Josh. ii. 9-11; ix. 9, 10, 24. Many of them were awed by
               these wonders, and made no resistance. Others defied God and came out to
               battle. These occupied the fortified cities, were the most inveterate
               heathen&#8212;the aristocracy of idolatry, the kings, the nobility and gentry,
               the priests, with their crowds of satellite, and retainers that aided in
               idolatrous rites, and the military forces, with the chief profligates of both
               sexes. Many facts corroborate the general position. Such as the multitude
               of <i>tributaries</i> in the midst of Israel, and that
               too, after they had "waxed strong," and the uttermost nations quaked at the
               terror of

               their name&#8212;the Canaanites, Philistines, and others, who became
               proselytes&#8212;as the Nethenims, Uriah the Hittite&#8212;Rahab, who married
               one of the princes of Judah&#8212;Ittai&#8212;the six hundred
               Gitites&#8212;David's body guard. 2 Sam. xv. 18, 21. Obededom the Gittite,
               adopted into the tribe of Levi. Comp. 2 Sam. vi. 10, 11, with 1
               Chron. xv. 18, and 1 Chron. xxvi. 45&#8212;Jaziz, and Obil. 1 Chron.
               xxvi. 30, 31, 33. Jephunneh the father of Caleb, the Kenite, registered
               in the genealogies of the tribe of Judah, and the one hundred and
               fifty thousand Canaanites, employed by Solomon in the building of the
               Temple<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN29"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN29"></a>. Besides, the greatest miracle on record,
               was wrought to save a portion of those very Canaanites, and for the
               destruction of those who would exterminate them. Josh. x. 12-14.
               Further&#8212;the terms employed in the directions regulating the disposal
               of the Canaanites, such as "drive out," "put out," "cast out," "expel,"
               "dispossess," &amp;c. seem used interchangeably with "consume," "destroy,"
               "overthrow," &amp;c., and thus indicate the sense in which the latter words
               are used. As an illustration of the meaning generally attached to these and
               similar terms, we refer to the history of the Amelekites. "I will
               utterly put out the remembrance of Amelek from under heaven." Ex.
               xxvii. 14. "Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amelek from
               under heaven; thou shalt not forget it." Deut. xxv. 19. "Smite Amelek and
               <em>utterly destroy</em> all that they have, and spare them not,
               but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep."
               1 Sam. xv. 2, 3. "Saul smote the Amelekites, and took Agag the
               king of the Amelekites, alive and UTTERLY DESTROYED ALL THE
               PEOPLE with the edge of the sword." Verses 7, 8. In verse 20,
               Saul says, "I have brought Agag, the king of Amelek, and have
               <em>utterly destroyed</em> the Amelekites." In 1 Sam. xxx. we find the
               Amelekites marching an army into Israel, and sweeping everything before
               them&#8212;and this in about eighteen years after they had
               <em>all been</em> "UTTERLY DESTROYED!" Deut. xx. 16, 17, will probably be
               quoted against the preceding view. We argue that the command in these
               verses, did not include all the individuals of the Canaanitish nations,
               but only the inhabitants of the <em>cities</em>, (and even those
               conditionally,) because, only the inhabitants of the <em>cities</em> are
               specified,&#8212;"of the <em>cities</em> of these people thou shalt save
               alive nothing that breatheth." Cities

               then, as now, were pest-houses of vice&#8212;they reeked with abominations
               little practiced in the country. On this account their influence
               would be far more perilous to the Israelites than that of the country.
               Besides, they were the centres of idolatry&#8212;there were the temples
               and altars, and idols, and priests, without number. Even their buildings,
               streets, and public walks were so many visibilities of idolatry.
               The reason assigned in the 18th verse for exterminating them,
               strengthens the idea,&#8212;"that they teach you not to do after all the
               abominations which they have done unto their gods." This would
               be a reason for exterminating <em>all</em> the nations and individuals
               <em>around</em> them, as all were idolaters; but God commanded them, in
               certain cases, to spare the inhabitants. Contact with <em>any</em> of
               them would be perilous&#8212;with the inhabitants of the <em>cities</em>
               peculiarly, and of the <i>Canaanitish</i> cities
               pre-eminently so. The 10th and 11th verses contain the general rule
               prescribing the method in which cities were to be summoned to surrender.
               They were first to receive the offer of peace&#8212;if it was accepted, the
               inhabitants became <i>tributaries</i>&#8212;but if
               they came out against Israel in battle, the <em>men</em> were to be
               killed, and the women and little ones saved alive. The 15th verse restricts
               this lenient treatment to the inhabitants of the cities <em>afar off</em>.
               The 16th directs as to the disposal of the inhabitants of Canaanitish cities.
               They were to save alive "nothing that breathed." The common
               mistake has been, in supposing that the command in the 15th verse
               refers to the <em>whole system of directions preceding</em>, commencing
               with the 10th, whereas it manifestly refers only to the
               <em>inflictions</em> specified in the 12th, 13th, and 14th, making a
               distinction between those <i>Canaanitish</i> cities that
               <em>fought</em>, and the cities <em>afar off</em> that fought&#8212;in
               one case destroying the males and females, and in the other, the
               <em>males</em> only. The offer of peace, and the <em>conditional
                  preservation</em>, were as really guarantied to
               <i>Canaanitish</i> cities as to others. Their inhabitants
               were not to be exterminated unless they came out against Israel in battle.
               But let us settle this question by the "law and the testimony."
               "There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel
               save the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon; all others they took in
               battle. For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they
               should COME OUT AGAINST ISRAEL IN BATTLE, that he might destroy
               them utterly, and that they might have no favor, but that he might
               destroy them, as the Lord commanded Moses." Josh. xix. 19, 20.
               That is, if they had <em>not</em> come out against Israel in battle, they
               would

               have had "favor" shown them, and would not have been "<em>destroyed
                  utterly.</em>" The great design was to <em>transfer the territory</em>
               of the Canaanites to the Israelites, and along with it,
               <em>absolute sovereignty in every respect</em>; to annihilate
               their political organizations, civil polity,
               and jurisprudence and their system of religion, with all its rights
               and appendages; and to substitute therefor, a pure theocracy, administered
               by Jehovah, with the Israelites as His representatives and agents.
               In a word the people were to be <i>denationalized</i>,
               their political existence annihilated, their idol temples, altars, images
               groves and heathen rites destroyed, and themselves put under tribute. Those
               who resisted the execution of Jehovah's purpose were to be killed, while
               those who quietly submitted to it were to be spared. All had the
               choice of these alternatives, either free egress out of the
               land<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r3_FN30"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootE4r3_FN30"></a>; or
               acquiescence in the decree, with life and residence as tributaries,
               under the protection of the government; or resistance to the execution
               of the decree, with death. "<em>And it shall come to pass, if they
                  will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, the
                  Lord liveth as they taught my people to swear by Baal</em>; THEN SHALL
               THEY BE BUILT IN THE MIDST OF MY PEOPLE."

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r3_FN28"></a><a href="#FootE4r3_FN28">A</a>: Perhaps it will be objected, that the
               preservation of the Gibeonites, and of Rahab and her kindred, was a violation
               of the command of God. We answer, if it had been, we might expect some such
               intimation. If God had strictly commanded them to <em>exterminate all the
                  Canaanites</em>, their pledge to save themselves was neither a repeal of the
               statute, nor absolution for the breach of it. If
               <i>unconditional destruction</i> was the import of the
               command, would God have permitted such an act to pass without rebuke? Would
               he have established such a precedent when Israel had hardly passed the
               threshold of Canaan, and was then striking the first blow of a half century
               war? What if they <em>had</em> passed their word to Rahab and
               the Gibeonites? Was that more binding than God's command? So Saul seems to
               have passed <em>his</em> word to Agag; yet Samuel hewed him in
               pieces, because in saving his life, Saul had violated God's command. When
               Saul sought to slay the Gibeonites in "his zeal for the children of Israel
               and Judah," God sent upon Israel three years famine for it. When David
               inquired of them what atonement he should make, they say, "The man that
               devised against us, that we should be destroyed from <em>remaining in any
                  of the coasts of Israel</em>, let seven of his sons be delivered," &amp;c.
               2 Sam. xxii. 1-6.
            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r3_FN29"></a><a href="#FootE4r3_FN29">B</a>: If the Canaanites were devoted by God to
               unconditional extermination, to have employed them in the erection of the
               temple,&#8212;what was it but the climax of impiety? As well might they
               pollute its altars with swine's flesh, or make their sons pass
               through the fire to Moloch.
            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r3_FN30"></a><a href="#FootE4r3_FN30">C</a>: Suppose all the Canaanitish nations had
               abandoned their territory at the tidings of Israel's approach, did God's
               command require the Israelites to chase them to the ends of the earth and hunt
               them out, until every Canaanite was destroyed? It is too preposterous for
               belief and yet it follows legitimately from that construction,
               which interprets the terms "consume," "destroy," "destroy utterly," &amp;c. to
               mean unconditional, individual extermination.

               [The original design of the preceding Inquiry embraced a much
               wider range of topics. It was soon found, however, that to fill up the
               outline would be to make a volume. Much of the foregoing has therefore
               been thrown into a mere series of <i>indices</i>, to
               trains of thought and classes of proof which, however limited or imperfect,
               may perhaps, afford some facilities to those who have little leisure for
               protracted investigation.]

            THE BIBLE AGAINST SLAVERY.
            <br><br></p>
         <p>
            The spirit of slavery never seeks refuge in the Bible of its own accord.
            The horns of the altar are its last resort&#8212;seized only in desperation,
            as it rushes from the terror of the avenger's arm. Like other
            unclean spirits, it "hateth the light, neither cometh to the light,
            lest its deeds should be reproved." Goaded to phrenzy in its conflicts
            with conscience and common sense, denied all quarter, and hunted from
            every covert, it vaults over the sacred inclosure and courses up and
            down the Bible, "seeking rest, and finding none." THE LAW OF LOVE,
            glowing on every page, flashes around it an omnipresent anguish and
            despair. It shrinks from the hated light, and howls under the consuming
            touch, as demons quailed before the Son of God, and shrieked,
            "Torment us not." At last, it slinks away under the types of the
            Mosaic system, and seeks to burrow out of sight among their shadows.
            Vain hope! Its asylum is its sepulchre; its city of refuge, the city of
            destruction. It flies from light into the sun; from heat, into devouring
            fire; and from the voice of God into the thickest of His
            thunders.

            <h3><a name="E4r4_def"></a>
               DEFINITION OF SLAVERY.

            </h3>
            <p><a name="E4r4_def_neg"></a>
               If we would know whether the Bible sanctions slavery, we must determine
               <em>what slavery is</em>. An element, is one thing; a relation, another;
               an appendage, another. Relations and appendages presuppose other
               things to which they belong. To regard them as the things themselves,
               or as constituent parts of them, leads to endless fallacies.

               Mere political disabilities are often confounded with slavery; so are
               many relations, and tenures, indispensible to the social state. We will
               specify some of these.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. PRIVATION OF SUFFRAGE. Then minors are slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. INELIGIBILITY TO OFFICE. Then females are slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               3. TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. Then slaveholders in the District of
               Columbia are slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               4. PRIVATION OF ONE'S OATH IN LAW. Then atheists are slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               5. PRIVATION OF TRIAL BY JURY. Then all in France are slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               6. BEING REQUIRED TO SUPPORT A PARTICULAR RELIGION. Then
               the people of England are slaves.

            </p>
            <p>
               7. APPRENTICESHIP. The rights and duties of master and apprentice are
               correlative. The <em>claim</em> of each upon the other results from
               his <em>obligation</em> to the other. Apprenticeship is based on the
               principle of equivalent for value received. The rights of the apprentice
               are secured, equally with those of the master. Indeed while the law is
               <em>just</em> to the former it is <em>benevolent</em> to the latter;
               its main design being rather to benefit the apprentice than the master.
               To the master it secures a mere compensation&#8212;to the apprentice, both a
               compensation and a virtual gratuity in addition, he being of the two
               the greatest gainer. The law not only recognizes the <em>right</em> of
               the apprentice to a reward for his labor, but appoints the wages, and
               enforces the payment. The master's claim covers only the <em>services</em>
               of the apprentice. The apprentice's claim covers <em>equally</em> the
               services of the master. Neither can hold the other as property; but each
               holds property in the services of the other, and BOTH EQUALLY. Is this
               slavery?

            </p>
            <p>
               8. FILIAL SUBORDINATION AND PARENTAL CLAIMS. Both are nature's
               dictates, and intrinsic elements of the social state; the natural affections
               which blend parent and child in one, excite each to discharge those offices
               incidental to the relation, and are a shield for mutual protection. The
               parent's legal claim to the child's services, is a slight return for the care
               and toil of his rearing, exclusively of outlays for support and education.
               This provision is, with the mass of mankind, indispensable to the
               preservation of the family state. The child, in helping his parents, helps
               himself&#8212;increases a common stock, in which he has a share; while his
               most faithful services do but acknowledge a debt that money cannot cancel.

            </p>
            <p>
               9. CLAIMS OF GOVERNMENT ON SUBJECTS. Governments owe their
               subjects protection; subjects owe just governments allegiance and
               support. The obligations of both are reciprocal, and the benefits
               received by both are mutual, equal, and voluntarily rendered.

            </p>
            <p>
               10. BONDAGE FOR CRIME. Must innocence be punished because
               guilt suffers penalties? True, the criminal works for the government
               without pay; and well he may. He owes the government. A century's
               work would not pay its drafts on him. He will die a public
               defaulter. Because laws make men pay their debts, shall those be
               forced to pay who owe nothing? The law makes no criminal, PROPERTY.
               It restrains his liberty, and makes him pay something, a
               mere penny in the pound, of his debt to the government; but it does
               not make him a chattel. Test it. To own property, is to own its
               product. Are children born of convicts, government property?
               Besides, can <i>property</i> be guilty? Can
               <i>chattels</i> deserve punishment?

            </p>
            <p>
               11. RESTRAINTS UPON FREEDOM. Children are restrained by parents,
               pupils, by teachers, patients, by physicians, corporations, by charters,
               and legislatures, by constitutions. Embargoes, tariffs, quarantine, and
               all other laws, keep men from doing as they please. Restraints are the
               web of civilized society, warp and woof. Are they slavery? then a
               government of LAW, is the climax of slavery!

            </p>
            <p>
               12. INVOLUNTARY OR COMPULSORY SERVICE. A juryman is empannelled
               against his will, and sit he <em>must</em>. A sheriff orders his posse;
               bystanders <em>must</em> turn in. Men are <em>compelled</em> to remove
               nuisances, pay fines and taxes, support their families, and "turn to the right
               as the law directs," however much against their wills. Are they
               therefore slaves? To confound slavery with involuntary service is absurd.
               Slavery is a <i>condition</i>. The slave's
               <em>feelings</em> toward it cannot alter its nature. Whether he desires or
               detests it, the condition remains the same. The slave's willingness to be a
               slave is no palliation of the slaveholder's guilt. Suppose he should really
               believe himself a chattel, and consent to be so regarded by others, would
               that <em>make</em> him a chattel, or make those guiltless who
               <em>hold</em> him as such? I may be sick of life, and I tell the assassin
               so that stabs me; is he any the less a murderer? Does my <em>consent</em>
               to his crime, atone for it? my partnership in his guilt, blot out his part of
               it? The slave's willingness to be a slave, so far from lessening the guilt of
               his "owner," aggravates it. If slavery has so palsied his mind that he looks
               upon himself as a chattel, and consents to be one, actually to hold him as
               such, falls in with his delusion, and confirms the impious falsehood. These
               very feelings and convictions of the slave, (if such were possible) increase
               a hundred fold the guilt of the master, and call upon him in thunder,
               immediately to recognize him as a MAN, and thus break the sorcery

               that cheats him out of his birthright&#8212;the consciousness of his worth
               and destiny.

            </p>
            <p>
               Many of the foregoing conditions are <em>appendages</em> of slavery, but
               no one, nor all of them together, constitute its intrinsic unchanging
               element.

            </p>
            <p><a name="E4r4_def_aff"></a>
               ENSLAVING MEN IS REDUCING THEM TO ARTICLES OF PROPERTY&#8212;making
               free agents, chattels&#8212;converting <i>persons</i>
               into <i>things</i>&#8212;sinking immortality into
               <i>merchandize</i>. A <i>slave</i>
               is one held in this condition. In law, "he owns nothing, and can acquire
               nothing." His right to himself is abrogated. If he say <em>my</em> hands,
               <em>my</em> body, <em>my</em> mind, MY<em>self</em>, they are
               figures of speech. To <em>use himself</em> for his own good, is a
               <em>crime</em>. To keep what he earns, is <em>stealing</em>. To take
               his body into his own keeping, is <i>insurrection</i>.
               In a word, the profit of his master is made the END of his being, and he, a
               <em>mere means</em> to that end&#8212;a mere means to an end into which
               his interests do not enter, of which they constitute no
               portion<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN1"></a>. MAN, sunk to a
               <em>thing!</em> the intrinsic element, the <em>principle</em> of
               slavery; MEN, bartered, leased, mortgaged, bequeathed, invoiced, shipped in
               cargoes, stored as goods, taken on executions, and knocked off at a public
               outcry! Their <em>rights</em>, another's conveniences; their interests,
               wares on sale; their happiness, a household utensil; their personal
               inalienable ownership, a serviceable article or a plaything, as best suits the
               humour of the hour; their deathless nature, conscience, social affections,
               sympathies, hopes&#8212;marketable commodities! We repeat it, THE REDUCTION
               OF PERSONS TO THINGS! Not robbing a man of privileges, but of
               <em>himself</em>; not loading him with burdens, but making him a
               <em>beast of burden</em>; not restraining liberty, but

               subverting it; not curtailing rights, but abolishing them; not inflicting
               personal cruelty, but annihilating <em>personality</em>; not exacting
               involuntary labor, but sinking man into an <em>implement</em> of labor;
               not abridging human comforts, but abrogating human <em>nature</em>; not
               depriving an animal of immunities, but despoiling a rational being of
               attributes&#8212;uncreating a MAN, to make room for a <em>thing</em>!

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN1"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN1">A</a>: To deprive human nature of <em>any</em>
               of its rights is <em>oppression</em>; to take away
               the <em>foundation</em> of its rights is slavery. In other words, whatever
               sinks man from an END to a mere <em>means</em>, just so far makes him a
               slave. Hence West-India apprenticeship retained the cardinal principle of
               slavery. The apprentice, during three-fourths of his time, was forced to
               labor, and robbed of his earnings; just so far forth he was a <em>mere
                  means</em>, a slave. True in other respects slavery was abolished in the
               British West Indies August, 1834. Its bloodiest features were blotted
               <em>out</em>&#8212;but the meanest and most despicable of
               all&#8212;forcing the poor to work for the rich without pay three fourths of
               their time, with a legal officer to flog them if they demurred at the outrage,
               was one of the provisions of the "Emancipation Act!" For the glories of that
               luminary, abolitionists thanked God, while they mourned that it rose behind
               clouds and shone through an eclipse.

            </p>
            <p>
               [West India apprenticeship is now (August 1838) abolished. On the first of
               the present month, every slave in every British island and colony stood up a
               freeman!&#8212;Note to fourth edition.]
            </p>
            <p><a name="E4r4_def_leg"></a>
               That this is American slavery, is shown by the laws of slave states.
               Judge Stroud, in his "Sketch of the Laws relating to Slavery," says,
               "The cardinal principle of slavery, that the slave is not to be ranked
               among sentient beings, but among <em>things</em>&#8212;obtains as
               undoubted law in all of these [the slave] states." The law of South Carolina
               says, "Slaves shall be deemed, held, taken, reputed, and adjudged in law to
               be chattels personal in the hands of their owners and possessors, and
               their executors, administrators, and assigns, to ALL INTENTS, CONSTRUCTIONS,
               AND PURPOSES WHATSOEVER." <em>Brev. Dig.</em>, 229. In Louisiana,
               "A slave is one who is in the power of a master to whom he belongs;
               the master may sell him, dispose of his person, his industry, and his
               labor; he can do nothing, possess nothing, nor acquire any thing, but
               what must belong to his master."&#8212;<em>Civ. Code</em>, Art. 35.

            </p>
            <p>
               This is American slavery. The eternal distinction between a person
               and a thing, trampled under foot&#8212;the crowning distinction of all
               others&#8212;alike the source, the test, and the measure of their
               value&#8212;the rational, immortal principle, consecrated by God to universal
               homage in a baptism of glory and honor, by the gift of his Son, his Spirit,
               his word, his presence, providence, and power; his shield, and staff, and
               sheltering wing; his opening heavens, and angels ministering, and
               chariots of fire, and songs of morning stars, and a great voice in heaven
               proclaiming eternal sanctions, and confirming the word with signs

               Just after the Israelites were emancipated from their bondage in
               Egypt, while they stood before Sinai to receive the law, as the trumpet
               waxed louder, and the mount quaked and blazed, God spake the ten
               commandments from the midst of clouds and thunderings. Two of
               those commandments deal death to slavery. "THOU SHALT NOT STEAL,"
               or, "thou shalt not take from another what <em>belongs</em> to him." All
               man's powers are God's gift to HIM. Each of them is a part of himself,
               and all of them together constitute himself. All else that belongs
               to man, is acquired by the <em>use</em> of these powers. The interest
               belongs to him, because the principal does; the product is his, because he is
               the producer. Ownership of any thing, is ownership of its <em>use</em>.
               The right to use according to will, is <em>itself</em> ownership. The
               eighth commandment presupposes and assumes the right of every man to his
               powers, and their product. Slavery robs of both. A man's right to
               himself, is the only right absolutely original and intrinsic&#8212;his right
               to anything else is merely <i>relative</i> to this, is
               derived from it, and held only by virtue of it. SELF-RIGHT is the
               <i>foundation right</i>&#8212;the <em>post in
                  the middle</em>, to which all other rights are fastened. Slaveholders, when
               talking about their RIGHT to their slaves, always assume their own right
               to themselves. What slave-holder ever undertook to prove his right
               to himself? He knows it to be a self-evident proposition, that <em>a man
                  belongs to himself</em>&#8212;that the right is intrinsic and absolute. In
               making out his own title, he makes out the title of every human being. As the
               fact of being <em>a man</em> is itself the title, the whole human family
               have one common title deed. If one man's title is valid, all are valid. If
               one is worthless, all are. To deny the validity of the <em>slave's</em>
               title is to deny the validity of <em>his own</em>; and yet in the act of
               making a man a slave, the slaveholder <em>asserts</em> the validity of
               his own title, while he seizes him as his property who has the
               <em>same</em> title. Further, in making him a slave, he does not merely
               disfranchise of humanity <em>one</em> individual, but UNIVERSAL MAN. He
               destroys the foundations. He annihilates <em>all rights</em>. He attacks
               not only the human race, but <i>universal being</i>, and
               rushes upon JEHOVAH. For rights are <em>rights</em>; God's are no
               more&#8212;man's are no less.

               The eighth commandment forbids the taking of <em>any part</em> of that
               which belongs to another. Slavery takes the <em>whole</em>. Does the same
               Bible which prohibits the taking of <em>any</em> thing from him, sanction
               the taking of <em>every</em> thing! Does it thunder wrath against the man
               who robs

               his neighbor of a <em>cent</em>, yet commission him to rob his neighbour
               of <em>himself?</em> Slaveholding is the highest possible violation of the
               eight commandment. To take from a man his earnings, is theft. But to take the
               <em>earner</em>, is a compound, life-long theft&#8212;supreme robbery that
               vaults up the climax at a leap&#8212;the dread, terrific, giant robbery, that
               towers among other robberies a solitary horror. The eight commandment
               forbids the taking away, and the <a name="E4r4_mor_covet"></a> tenth adds,
               "Thou shalt not <em>covet</em> any thing that is thy neighbor's;" thus
               guarding every man's right to himself and property, by making not only the
               actual taking away a sin, but even that state of mind which would
               <em>tempt</em> to it. Who ever made human beings slaves,
               without <em>coveting</em> them? Why take from them their time, labor,
               liberty, right of self-preservation and improvement, their right to acquire
               property, to worship according to conscience, to search the Scriptures, to
               live with their families, and their right to their own bodies, if they do not
               <em>desire</em> them? They COVET them for purposes of gain, convenience,
               lust of dominion, of sensual gratification, of pride and ostentation. THEY
               BREAK THE TENTH COMMANDMENT, and pluck down upon their heads the plagues that
               are written in the book. <em>Ten</em> commandments constitute the brief
               compend of human duty. <em>Two</em> of these brand slavery as sin.

               The oppression of the Israelites in Egypt, and the wonders wrought
               for their deliverance, proclaim the reason for such a law at such a time.
               They had just been emancipated. The tragedies of their house of bondage
               were the realities of yesterday, and peopled their memories with

               thronging horrors. They had just witnessed God's testimony against
               oppression in the plagues of Egypt&#8212;the burning blains on man and
               beast; the dust quickened into loathsome life, and swarming upon every
               living thing; the streets, the palaces, the temples, and every house
               heaped up with the carcases of things abhorred; the kneading troughs
               and ovens, the secret chambers and the couches, reeking and dissolving
               with the putrid death; the pestilence walking in darkness at noonday,
               the devouring locusts, and hail mingled with fire, the first-born
               death-struck, and the waters blood; and last of all, that dread high hand
               and stretched-out arm, that whelmed the monarch and his hosts, and
               strewed their corpses on the sea. All this their eyes had looked upon;
               earth's proudest city, wasted and thunder-scarred, lying in desolation,
               and the doom of oppressors traced on her ruins in the hand-writing of
               God, glaring in letters of fire mingled with blood&#8212;a blackened monument
               of wrath to the uttermost against the stealers of men. No wonder
               that God, in a code of laws prepared for such a people at such a
               time, should uprear on its foreground a blazing beacon to flash terror
               on slaveholders. "<em>He that stealeth a man and selleth him, or if he be
                  found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death."</em> Ex. xxi. 16. Deut.

            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN4"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN4">A</a>: Jarchi, the most eminent of the Jewish
               Commentators, who wrote seven hundred years ago, in his comment on this
               stealing and making merchandize of men, gives the meaning thus:&#8212;"Using
               a man against his will, as a servant lawfully purchased; yea, though he
               should use his services ever so little, only to the value of a farthing, or
               use but his arm to lean on to support him, <em>if he be forced so to act as
                  a servant</em>, the person compelling him but once to do so, shall die as
               a thief, whether he has sold him or not."

            <p>
               The word <i>G&#257;n&#257;bh</i>
               here rendered <i>stealeth,</i> means, the taking of what
               belongs to another, whether by violence or fraud; the same word
               is used in the eight commandment, and prohibits both robbery and
               theft.

            <p>
               The crime specified, is that of depriving SOMEBODY of the ownership
               of a man. Is this somebody a master? and is the crime that of depriving
               a master of his servant? Then it would have been "he that stealeth"
               a <i>servant</i>, not "he that stealeth a
               <i>man</i>." If the crime had been the taking of an
               individual from <em>another</em>, then the <em>term</em> used would
               have been expressive of that relation, and most especially if it was the
               relation of property and <i>proprietor!</i></p>
            <p>
               The crime is stated in a three-fold form&#8212;man <em>stealing</em>,
               <em>selling</em>, and
               <em>holding</em>. All are put on a level, and whelmed under one
               penalty&#8212;<b>DEATH</b><a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN5"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN5"></a>. This <em>somebody</em> deprived of the ownership of a
               man, is the <em>man himself</em>, robbed of personal ownership. Joseph
               said, "Indeed I was <em>stolen</em> away out of the land of the Hebrews."
               Gen. xl. 15. How <em>stolen?</em> His brethren sold him as an article of
               merchandize. Contrast this penalty for <i>man</i>-stealing
               with that for <i>property</i>-stealing, Ex. xxii. 14. If
               a man had stolen an <em>ox</em> and killed or sold it, he was
               to restore five oxen; if he had neither sold nor killed it, two oxen.
               But in the case of stealing a <em>man</em>, the <em>first</em> act
               drew down the utmost power of punishment; however often repeated or aggravated
               the crime, human penalty could do no more. The fact that the penalty for
               <i>man</i>-stealing was death, and the penalty for
               <i>property</i>-stealing, the mere restoration of double,
               shows that the two cases were adjudicated on totally different principles.
               The man stolen might be diseased or totally past labor, consequently
               instead of being profitable to the thief, he would be a tax
               upon him, yet death was still the penalty, though not a cent's worth of
               <i>property-value</i> was taken. The penalty for stealing
               property was a mere property-penalty. However large the theft, the payment of
               double wiped out the score. It might have a greater money value than
               a thousand men, yet death was not the penalty, nor maiming, nor
               braiding, nor even stripes, but double <em>of the same kind</em>. Why was
               not the rule uniform? When a <em>man</em> was stolen why was not the thief
               required to restore double of the same kind&#8212;two men, or if he had
               sold him, five men? Do you say that the man-thief might not <em>have</em>
               them? So the ox-thief might not have two oxen, or if he had killed it,
               five. But if God permitted men to hold <em>men</em> as property, equally
               with oxen, the man-thief, could get men with whom to pay the penalty,
               as well as the ox-thief, oxen. Further, when property was stolen, the
               legal penalty was a compensation to the person injured. But when
               a <em>man</em> was stolen, no property compensation was offered. To tender
               money as an equivalent, would have been to repeat the outrage with
               intolerable aggravations. Compute the value of a MAN in <em>money!</em>
               Throw dust into the scale against immortality! The law recoiled
               from such supreme insult and impiety. To have permitted the man-thief
               to expiate his crime by restoring double, would have been making
               the repetition of crime its atonement. But the infliction of death for
               man-stealing exacted the utmost possibility of reparation. It wrung
               from the guilty wretch as he gave up the ghost, the testimony of blood,

               and death-groans, to the infinite dignity and worth of man,&#8212;a proclamation
               to the universe, voiced in mortal agony, "MAN IS INVIOLABLE."&#8212;a
               confession shrieked in phrenzy at the grave's mouth&#8212;"I die accursed,
               and God is just."

               If God permitted man to hold man as property, why did he punish
               for stealing that kind of property infinitely more than for stealing any
               other kind of property? Why punish with death for stealing a very
               little of <em>that</em> sort of property, and make a mere fine the penalty
               for stealing a thousand times as much, of any other sort of
               property&#8212;especially
               if by his own act, God had annihilated the difference between
               man and <i>property</i>, by putting him on a level with
               it?

            </p>
            <p>
               The guilt of a crime, depends much upon the nature, character, and
               condition of the victim. To steal is a crime, whoever the thief, or
               whatever the plunder. To steal bread from a full man, is theft; to
               steal it from a starving man, is both theft and murder. If I steal my
               neighbor's property, the crime consists not in altering the
               <em>nature</em> of the
               article, but in taking as <em>mine</em> what is <em>his</em>. But
               when I take my neighbor himself, and first make him
               <i>property</i>, and then <em>my</em> property, the
               latter act, which was the sole crime in the former case, dwindles to
               nothing. The sin in stealing a man, is not the transfer from its owner
               to another of that which is already property, but the turning of
               <i>personality</i>
               into <i>property</i>. True, the attributes of man remain,
               but the rights
               and immunities which grow out of them are annihilated. It is the
               first law both of reason and revelation, to regard things and beings as
               they are; and the sum of religion, to feel and act toward them according
               to their value. Knowingly to treat them otherwise is sin; and
               the degree of violence done to their nature, relations, and value, measures
               its guilt. When things are sundered which God has indissolubly
               joined, or confounded in one, which he has separated by infinite
               extremes; when sacred and eternal distinctions, which he has garnished
               with glory, are derided and set at nought, then, if ever, sin reddens
               to its "scarlet dye." The sin specified in the passage, is that of
               doing violence to the <i>nature</i> of a
               <i>man</i>&#8212;to his intrinsic value as a rational
               being. In the verse preceding the one under consideration, and
               in that which follows, the same principle is laid down. Verse 15,
               "He that smiteth his father or his mother shall surely be put to
               death." Verse. 17, "He that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely
               be put to death." If a Jew smote his neighbor, the law merely
               smote him in return; but if the blow was given to a
               <i>parent</i>, it struck
               the smiter dead. The parental relation is the <em>centre</em> of human
               society.
               God guards it with peculiar care. To violate that, is to violate all.

               Whoever tramples on that, shows that <em>no</em> relation has any
               sacredness
               in his eyes&#8212;that he is unfit to move among human relations who violates
               one so sacred and tender. Therefore, the Mosaic law uplifted
               his bleeding corpse, and brandished the ghastly terror around the parental
               relation to guard it from impious inroads.

            </p>
            <p>
               Why such a difference in penalties, for the same act? Answer. 1.
               The relation violated was obvious&#8212;the distinction between parents and
               others self-evident, dictated by a law of nature. 2. The act was violence
               to nature&#8212;a suicide on constitutional susceptibilities. 3. The
               parental relation then, as now, was the focal point of the social system,
               and required powerful safe-guards. "<em>Honor thy father and
                  thy mother</em>," stands at the head of those commands which prescribe the
               duties of man to man; and throughout the Bible, the parental state is
               God's favorite illustration of his own relations to the human family.
               In this case, death was to be inflicted not for smiting a
               <i>man,</i> but a
               <i>parent</i>&#8212;<em>a distinction</em> made sacred by
               God, and fortified by a bulwark
               of defence. In the next verse, "He that stealeth a man," &amp;c., the
               SAME PRINCIPLE is wrought out in still stronger relief. The crime to
               be punished with death was not the taking of property from its owner,
               but violence to an <em>immortal nature</em>, the blotting out of a
               sacred <em>distinction</em>&#8212;making
               MEN "chattels."

               The incessant pains taken in the Old Testament to separate human
               beings from brutes and things, shows God's regard for this, his own
               distinction.
               "In the beginning" he proclaimed it to the universe as it rose
               into being. Creation stood up at the instant of its birth, to do it homage.
               It paused in adoration while God ushered forth its crowning work.
               Why that dread pause and that creating arm held back in mid career
               and that high conference in the godhead? "Let us make man in OUR
               IMAGE after OUR LIKENESS, and let him have dominion over the fish of
               the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle and over all
               the earth." Then while every living thing, with land, and sea, and
               firmament, and marshalled worlds, waited to swell the shout of morning
               stars&#8212;then God created man IN HIS OWN IMAGE; IN THE IMAGE OF
               GOD created he him." This solves the problem, IN THE IMAGE
               OF GOD, CREATED HE HIM. This distinction is often repeated
               and always with great solemnity. In Gen. i. 26-28, it is expressed in
               various forms. In Gen. v. 1, we find it again, "IN THE LIKENESS OF
               GOD MADE HE HIM." In Gen. ix. 6, again. After giving license to shed
               the blood of "every moving thing that liveth," it is added, "<em>Whoso
                  sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed, for</em> IN THE IMAGE
               OF GOD MADE HE MAN." As though it had been said, "All these creatures

               are your property, designed for your use&#8212;they have the likeness of
               earth, and their spirits go downward; but this other being, MAN, has
               my own likeness: IN THE IMAGE OF GOD made I man; an intelligent,
               moral, immortal agent, invited to all that I can give and he can be. So
               in Lev. xxiv. 17, 18, 21, "He that killeth any MAN shall surely be put
               to death; and he that killeth a beast shall make it good, beast for beast;
               and he that killeth a MAN he shall be put to death." So in Ps. viii. 5,
               6, we have an enumeration of particulars, each separating infinitely
               MEN from brutes and things! 1. "<em>Thou hast made him a little lower
                  than the angels."</em> Slavery drags him down among <em>brutes.</em>
               2. <em>"And
                  hast crowned him with glory and honor."</em> Slavery tears off his crown,
               and puts on a <em>yoke</em>. 3. <em>"Thou madest him to have
                  dominion</em><a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN6"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN6"></a> OVER <em>the
                  works of thy hands."</em> Slavery breaks his sceptre, and cast him down
               <em>among</em> those works&#8212;yea, <em>beneath them</em>.
               4. <em>"Thou hast put all things
                  under his feet</em>." Slavery puts HIM under the feet of an "owner."
               Who, but an impious scorner, dare thus strive with his Maker, and
               mutilate HIS IMAGE, and blaspheme the Holy One, who saith, <em>"Inasmuch
                  as ye did it unto one of the least of these, ye did it unto ME.</em>"

            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN6"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN6">A</a>: "Thou madest him to have dominion."
               In Gen. i. 28, God says to man,
               <em>"Have dominion</em> over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
               the air and over
               every living thing that moveth upon the earth," thus vesting in
               <em>every</em> human
               being the right of ownership over the earth, its products and animal life,
               and in <em>each</em> human being the <em>same</em> right. By so doing
               God prohibited the exercise of ownership by man over <em>man</em>; for the
               grant to <em>all</em> men of <em>equal</em> ownership, for
               ever <em>shut</em> out the possibility of their exercising ownership over
               <em>each other</em>, as whoever is the owner of a <em>man</em>, is
               the owner of his <em>right of property</em>&#8212;in other
               words, when one man becomes the property of another his rights become such
               too, his <em>right of property</em> is transferred to his "owner," and
               thus as far as <em>himself</em>
               is concerned, is annihilated. Finally, by originally vesting <em>all</em>
               men with dominion or ownership over property, God proclaimed the
               <em>right of all</em> to exercise
               it, and pronounced every man who takes it away a robber of the highest
               grade. Such is every slaveholder.

               In further prosecuting this inquiry, the Patriarchal and Mosaic systems
               will be considered together, as each reflects light upon the other,
               and as many regulations of the latter are mere
               <i>legal</i> forms of Divine
               institutions previously existing. As a <em>system</em>, the latter alone
               is of Divine authority. Whatever were the usages of the patriarchs
               God has not made them our exemplars.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN7"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN7"></a> The question

               is not what were Jewish <em>customs</em>, but what were the rules that

               under their shadow, hymning the praises of "those good old slaveholders and

               stanza celebrating patriarchal <em>concubinage</em>, winding off with a

               Before entering upon an analysis of the condition of servants under
               these two states of society, we will consider the import of certain terms
               which describe the mode of procuring them.

               IMPORT OF "BUY," AND "BOUGHT WITH MONEY."

            </h3>
            <p>
               As the Israelites were commanded to "buy" their servants, and as
               Abraham had servants "bought with money," it is argued that servants
               were articles of property! The sole ground for this belief is <em>the
                  terms themselves!</em> How much might be saved, if in discussion, the thing
               to be proved were always <em>assumed</em>! To beg the question in debate,
               is vast economy of midnight oil, and a wholesale forestaller of
               wrinkles and gray hairs. Instead of protracted investigation into
               Scripture usage, painfully collating passages, to settle the meaning of
               terms, let every man interpret the oldest book in the world by the usages
               of his own time and place, and the work is done. And then instead
               of one revelation, they might be multiplied as the drops of the morning,
               and every man have an infallible clue to the mind of the Spirit, in the
               dialect of his own neighborhood! What a Babel-jargon, to take it for
               granted that the sense in which words are <em>now</em> used, is the
               <em>inspired</em> sense. David says, "I prevented the dawning of the
               morning, and cried." What, stop the earth in its revolution! Two hundred years
               ago, <i>prevent</i> was used in its strict Latin sense,
               to <em>come before</em>, or <em>anticipate</em>. It
               is always used in this sense in the Old and New Testaments. David's
               expression, in the English of the nineteenth century, would be "Before
               the dawning of the morning I cried." In almost every chapter of the
               Bible, words are used in a sense now nearly, or quite obsolete, and
               sometimes in a sense totally <em>opposite</em> to their present meaning.
               A few examples follow: "I purposed to come to you, but was
               <i>let</i> (hindered)
               hitherto." "And the four <i>beasts</i> (living ones) fell
               down and worshiped
               God,"&#8212;"Whosoever shall <i>offend</i> (cause to sin) one
               of these little
               ones,"&#8212;Go out into the highways and <i>compel</i> (urge)
               them to come
               in,"&#8212;Only let your <i>conversation</i> (habitual conduct)
               be as becometh the
               Gospel,"&#8212;"The Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the
               <i>quick</i> (living)
               and the dead,"&#8212;They that seek me <i>early</i> (earnestly)
               shall find me,"

               So when tribulation or persecution ariseth
               <i>by-and-by</i> (immediately) they
               are offended." Nothing is more mutable than language. Words, like
               bodies, are always throwing off some particles and absorbing others.
               So long as they are mere representatives, elected by the whims of universal
               suffrage, their meaning will be a perfect volatile, and to cork it
               up for the next century is an employment sufficiently silly (to speak
               within bounds) for a modern Bible-Dictionary maker. There never
               was a shallower conceit than that of establishing the sense attached to
               a word centuries ago, by showing what it means <em>now</em>. Pity that
               fashionable
               mantuamakers were not a little quicker at taking hints from
               some Doctors of Divinity. How easily they might save their pious
               customers all qualms of conscience about the weekly shiftings of fashion,
               by proving that the last importation of Parisian indecency now "showing
               off" on promenade, was the very style of dress in which the modest
               and pious Sarah kneaded cakes for the angels. Since such a fashion
               flaunts along Broadway <em>now</em>, it <em>must</em> have trailed
               over Canaan four thousand years ago!

            </p>
            <p>
               The inference that the word buy, used to describe the procuring of
               servants, means procuring them as <i>chattels</i>, seems
               based upon the fallacy,
               that whatever <em>costs</em> money <em>is</em> money; that whatever or
               whoever
               you pay money <em>for</em>, is an article of property, and the fact of
               your paying for it, <em>proves</em> it property. 1. The children of
               Israel were required
               to purchase their firstborn from under the obligations of the priesthood,
               Num. xviii. 15, 16; iii. 45-51; Ex. xiii. 13; xxxiv. 20. This
               custom still exists among the Jews, and the word
               <i>buy</i> is still used to describe
               the transaction. Does this prove that their firstborn were or
               are, held as property? They were <i>bought</i> as really
               as were <em>servants</em>. 2. The Israelites were required to pay money
               for their own souls.
               This is called sometimes a ransom, sometimes an atonement. Were
               their souls therefore marketable commodities? 3. When the Israelites
               set apart themselves or their children to the Lord by vow, for the performance
               of some service, an express statute provided that a
               <i>price</i>
               should be set upon the "<em>persons</em>," and it prescribed the manner
               and <em>terms</em> of the "estimation" or valuation, by the payment of
               which, the persons might be <em>bought off</em> from the service vowed.
               The <em>price</em> for
               males from one month old to five years, was five shekels, for females,
               three; from five years old to twenty, for males, twenty shekels, for females,
               ten; from twenty years old to sixty, for males, fifty shekels, for
               females, thirty; above sixty years old, for males, fifteen shekels, for
               females,
               ten, Lev. xxvii. 2-8. What egregious folly to contend that all
               these descriptions of persons were goods and chattels because they

               were <em>bought</em> and their <em>prices</em> regulated by law!
               4. Bible saints <i>bought</i>
               their wives. Boaz bought Ruth. "Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the
               wife of Mahlon, have I <i>purchased</i> (bought) to be my
               wife." Ruth iv. 10.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN8"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN8"></a> Hosea bought his wife. "So I <i>bought</i>
               her to me for fifteen
               pieces of silver, and for an homer of Barley, and an half homer of
               barley." Hosea iii. 2. Jacob bought his wives Rachael and Leah,
               and not having money, paid for them in labor&#8212;seven years a piece.
               Gen. xxix. 15-23. Moses probably bought his wife in the same way,
               and paid for her by his labor, as the servant of her
               father.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN9"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN9"></a> Exod. ii. 21.
               Shechem, when negotiating with Jacob and his sons for Dinah,
               says, "Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
               as ye shall say unto me." Gen. xxxiv. 11, 12. David purchased
               Michael, and Othniel, Achsah, by performing perilous services for the
               fathers of the damsels. 1 Sam. xviii. 25-27; Judg. i. 12, 13. That
               the purchase of wives, either with money or by service, was the general
               practice, is plain from such passages as Ex. xxii. 17, and 1 Sam.
               xviii. 25. Among the modern Jews this usage exists, though now a
               mere form, there being no <em>real</em> purchase. Yet among their marriage
               ceremonies, is one called "marrying by the penny." The similarity
               in the methods of procuring wives and servants, in the terms employed
               in describing the transactions, and in the prices paid for each, are
               worthy of notice. The highest price of wives (virgins) and servants
               was the same. Comp. Deut, xxii. 28, 29, and Ex. xxii. 17, with Lev.
               xxvii. 2-8. The <i>medium</i> price of wives and servants
               was the same.
               Comp. Hos. iii. 2, with Ex. xxi. 32. Hosea seems to have paid one
               half in money and the other half in grain. Further, the Israelitish
               female bought-servants were <i>wives</i>, their husbands
               and masters being the same persons. Ex. xxi. 8, Judg. xix. 3, 27. If
               <em>buying</em> servants
               proves them property, buying wives proves <em>them</em> property. Why not
               contend that the <i>wives</i> of the ancient fathers of
               the faithful were their
               "chattels," and used as ready change at a pinch; and thence deduce

               the rights of modern husbands? Alas! Patriarchs and prophets are
               followed afar off! When will pious husbands live up to their Bible
               privileges, and become partakers with Old Testament worthies in the
               blessedness of a husband's rightful immunities! Refusing so to do, is
               questioning the morality of those "good old slaveholders and patriarchs,
               Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."

               (k&#257;n&#257;) is
               used in both verses. In the 9th, "a parcel of land" is "bought," in the 10th a
               "wife" is "bought." If the Israelites had been as profound at inferences as
               our modern Commentators, they would have put such a fact as this to the
               rack till they had tortured out of it a divine warrant for holding their wives

               This use of the word buy, is not peculiar to the Hebrew. In the
               Syriac, the common expression for "the espoused," is "the bought."
               Even so late as the 16th century, the common record of
               <i>marriages</i> in
               the old German Chronicles was, "A BOUGHT B."

            </p>
            <p>
               The word translated <i>buy</i>, is, like other words,
               modified by the nature of the subject to which it is applied. Eve said, "I
               have <i>gotten</i> (bought)
               a man from the Lord." She named him Cain, that is
               <i>bought</i>. "He
               that heareth reproof, getteth (buyeth) understanding," Prov. xv. 32.
               So in Isa. xi. 11. "The Lord shall set his hand again to recover (to
               <i>buy</i>) the remnant of his people." So
               Ps. lxxviii. 54. "He brought
               them to his mountain which his right hand had
               <i>purchased</i>," (gotten.)
               Neh. v. 8. "We of our ability have <i>redeemed</i>
               (bought) our brethren
               the Jews, that were sold unto the heathen." Here
               "<i>bought</i>" is not
               applied to persons reduced to servitude, but to those taken <em>out</em>
               of it.
               Prov. viii. 22. "The Lord possessed (bought) me in the beginning of
               his way." Prov. xix. 8. "He that <i>getteth</i> (buyeth)
               wisdom loveth
               his own soul." Finally, to <i>buy</i> is a
               <em>secondary</em> meaning of the Hebrew
               word <i>k&#257;n&#257;</i>.

            </p>
            <p>
               Even at this day the word <i>buy</i> is used to describe
               the procuring of
               servants, where slavery is abolished. In the British West Indies,
               where slaves became apprentices in 1834, they are still, (1837,)
               "bought." This is the current word in West India newspapers. Ten
               years since servants were "<i>bought</i>" in New York,
               and still are in New
               Jersey, as really as in Virginia, yet the different senses in which the
               word is used in those states, puts no man in a quandary. Under the
               system of legal <i>indenture</i> in Illinois, servants
               now are "<i>bought</i>."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN10"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN10"></a> Until
               recently immigrants to this country were "bought" in great
               numbers. By voluntary contract they engaged to work a given time
               to pay for their passage. This class of persons, called "redemptioners,"

               consisted at one time of thousands. Multitudes are "bought" <em>out</em>
               of slavery by themselves or others. Under the same roof with the writer
               is a "servant bought with money." A few weeks since, she was a
               slave; when "bought," she was a slave no longer. Alas! for our
               leading politicians if "buying" men makes them "chattels." The
               Whigs say, that Calhoun has been "bought" by the administration;
               and the other party, that Clay and Webster have been "bought" by
               the Bank. The histories of the revolution tell us that Benedict Arnold
               was "bought" by British gold, and that Williams, Paulding, and Van
               Wert, could not be "bought" by Major Andre. When a northern
               clergyman marries a rich southern widow, country gossip thus hits off
               the indecency, "The cotton bags <i>bought</i> him." Sir
               Robert Walpole said, "Every man has his price, and whoever will pay it, can
               <i>buy</i> him,"
               and John Randolph said, "The northern delegation is in the market;
               give me money enough, and I can <i>buy</i> them." The
               temperance publications
               tell us that candidates for office <i>buy</i> men with
               whiskey; and
               the oracles of street tattle, that the court, district attorney, and jury,
               in the late trial of Robinson were <i>bought</i>, yet we
               have no floating
               visions of "chattels personal," man-auctions, or coffles.

               The transaction between Joseph and the Egyptians gives a clue to
               the use of "buy" and "bought with money." Gen. xlvii. 18-26.
               The Egyptians proposed to Joseph to become servants. When the
               bargain was closed, Joseph said, "Behold I have
               <i>bought you</i> this day,"
               and yet it is plain that neither party regarded the persons
               <i>bought</i> as
               articles of property, but merely as bound to labor on certain conditions,
               to pay for their support during the famine. The idea attached

               by both parties to "buy us," and "behold I have bought you," was
               merely that of service voluntarily offered, and secured by contract, in
               return, for <em>value received</em>, and not at all that the Egyptians
               were bereft of their personal ownership, and made articles of property. And
               this buying of <i>services</i> (in this case it was but
               one-fifth part) is called in Scripture usage, <i>buying the
                  persons</i>. This case claims special notice,
               as it is the only one where the whole transaction of buying servants is
               detailed&#8212;the preliminaries, the process, the mutual acquiescence, and
               the permanent relation resulting therefrom. In all other instances, the
               mere fact is stated without particulars. In this case, the whole process
               is laid open. 1. The persons "bought," <em>sold themselves</em>, and of
               their own accord. 2. Paying for the permanent
               <i>service</i> of persons, or even a
               portion of it, is called "buying" those persons; just as paying for the
               <i>use</i> of land or houses for a number of years in
               succession is called
               in Scripture usage <i>buying</i> them. See
               Lev. xxv. 28, 33, and xxvii. 24.
               The objector, at the outset, takes it for granted, that servants were
               bought of <em>third</em> persons; and thence infers that they were
               articles of
               property. Both the alleged fact and the inference are <em>sheer
                  assumptions</em>.
               No instance is recorded, under the Mosaic system, in
               which a <em>master sold his servant</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               That servants who were "bought," <em>sold themselves</em>, is a fair
               inference from various passages of Scripture.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN12"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN12"></a> In Leviticus xxv. 47, the
	       <a name="E4r4_23"></a>
               case of the Israelite, who became the servant of the stranger, the
               words are, "If he SELL HIMSELF unto the stranger." Yet the 51st
               verse informs us that this servant was "BOUGHT" and that the
               price of his purchase was paid to <em>himself</em>. The <em>same
                  word</em>, and the same <em>form</em> of the word, which, in verse 47,
               is rendered <em>sell himself</em>, is
               in verse 39 of the same chapter, rendered <em>be sold</em>; in
               Deut. xxviii. 68,
               the same word is rendered "be sold." "And there ye shall BE SOLD
               unto your enemies for bond-men and bond-women and NO MAN SHALL
               BUY YOU." How could they "<em>be sold</em>" without <em>being
                  bought</em>? Our
               translation makes it nonsense. The word
               <i>M&#257;kar</i> rendered "<i>be
                  sold</i>"
               is used here in Hithpael conjugation, which is generally reflexive in
               its force, and like the middle voice in Greek, represents what an individual
               does for himself, and should manifestly have been rendered "ye
               shall <i>offer yourselves</i> for sale, and there shall be
               no purchaser." For a clue to Scripture usage on this point, see
               1 Kings xxi. 20. 25.&#8212;"Thou
               hast <i>sold thyself</i> to work evil." "There was none
               like unto Ahab which did sell <em>himself</em> to work wickedness."&#8212;2
               Kings xvii. 17.
               "They used divination and enchantments, and <i>sold
                  themselves</i> to do
               evil."&#8212;Isa. l. 1. "For your iniquities have ye <i>sold
                  yourselves."</i>
               Isa. lii. 3, "Ye have <i>sold yourselves</i> FOR NOUGHT,
               and ye shall be redeemed without money." See also, Jer. xxxiv. 14; Rom. vii.
               14, vi. 16; John, viii. 34, and the case of Joseph and the Egyptians, already
               quoted. In the purchase of wives, though spoken of rarely, it is generally
               stated that they were bought of <em>third</em> persons. If
               <i>servants</i> were
               bought of third persons, it is strange that no <em>instance</em> of it is
               on record.

            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN12"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN12">A</a>: Those
               who insist that the servants which the Israelites were commanded to
               buy of "the heathen which were round about" them, were to be bought of
               <em>third persons</em>,
               virtually charge God with the inconsistency of recognizing and affirming
               the right of those very persons to freedom, upon whom, say they, he pronounced
               the doom of slavery. For they tell us, that the sentence of death uttered
               against those heathen was commuted into slavery, which punishment God
               denounced against them. Now if "the heathen round about" were doomed to
               slavery, the <em>sellers</em> were doomed as well as the
               <em>sold</em>. Where, we ask, did the sellers get their
               right to sell? God by commanding the Israelites to BUY, affirmed the right of
               <em>somebody</em> to <em>sell</em>, and that the
               <em>ownership</em> of what was sold existed <em>somewhere</em>; which
               <em>right</em> and ownership he commanded them to <em>recognize</em>
               and <em>respect</em>. We repeat the question, where did the heathen
               <em>sellers</em> get their right to sell, since <em>they</em> were
               dispossessed of their right to <em>themselves</em> and doomed to slavery
               equally with those whom they sold. Did God's decree vest in them a right to
               <em>others</em> while it annulled
               their right to <em>themselves</em>? If, as the objector's argument
               assumes, one part of "the heathen round about" were <em>already</em> held
               as slaves by the other part, <em>such</em>
               of course were not <em>doomed</em> to slavery, for they were already
               slaves. So also, if those heathen who held them as slaves had a
               <em>right</em> to hold them, which right
               God commanded the Israelites to <em>buy out</em>, thus requiring them to
               recognize <em>it</em> as a <em>right</em>, and on no account to
               procure its transfer to themselves without paying
               to the holders an equivalent, surely, these
               <i>slaveholders</i> were not doomed by God
               to be slaves, for according to the objector, God had himself affirmed their
               right <em>to hold others as slaves</em>, and commanded his people to
               respect it.

               I. THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF SERVANTS.

            </h3>
            <p>
               The leading design of the laws defining the relations of master and
               servant, was the good of both parties&#8212;more especially the good of the
               <em>servants</em>. While the master's interests were guarded
               from injury,
               those of the servants were <em>promoted</em>. These laws made a merciful
               provision for the poorer classes, both of the Israelites and Strangers,
               not laying on burdens, but lightening them&#8212;they were a grant of
               <em>privileges</em> and <em>favors</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               I. BUYING SERVANTS WAS REGARDED AS A KINDNESS TO THE PERSONS
               BOUGHT, and as establishing between them and their purchasers
               a bond of affection and confidence. This is plain from the frequent

               use of it to illustrate the love and care of God for his chosen people.
               Deut. xxxii. 6; Ex. xv. 16; Ps. lxxiv. 2; Prov. viii. 22.

            </p>
            <p>
               II. NO STRANGER COULD JOIN THE FAMILY OF AN ISRAELITE WITHOUT
               BECOMING A PROSELYTE. Compliance with this condition was the
               <em>price of the privilege</em>. Gen. xvii. 9-14, 23, 27. In other
               words, to become a servant was virtually to become an
               Israelite.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN13"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN13"></a> In
               the light
               of this fact, look at the relation sustained by a proselyted servant to
               his master. Was it a sentence consigning to
               <i>punishment</i>, or a ticket
               of admission to <i>privileges</i>?

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN13"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN13">A</a>: The rites by which a stranger became a
               proselyte transformed him into a Jew. Compare 1 Chron. ii. 17, with
               2 Sam. xvii. 25. In Esther viii. 17, it is said "Many of the people of the
               land <i>became Jews</i>." In the Septuagint, the passage
               is thus rendered, "Many of the heathen were circumcised and became
               Jews." The intimate union and incorporation of the proselytes with the Hebrews
               is shown by such passages as Isa. lvi. 6, 7, 8;
               Eph. ii. 11, 22; Num. x. 29-32.
               Calmet, Art. Proselyte, says "They were admitted to all the prerogatives
               of the people of the Lord." Mahommed doubtless borrowed from the laws and
               usages of the Jews, his well known regulation for admitting to all civil and
               religious privileges, all proselytes of whatever nation or religion.
            </p>
            <p>
               III. EXPULSION FROM THE FAMILY WAS THE DEPRIVATION OF A PRIVILEGE
               IF NOT A PUNISHMENT. When Sarah took umbrage at the conduct
               of Hagar and Ishmael, her servants, "She said unto Abraham
               <em>cast out</em> this bond-woman and her son." * * And Abraham rose
               up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave
               it unto Hagar and the child, and <em>sent her away</em>. Gen. xxi. 10, 14;
               in Luke xvi. 1-8, our Lord tells us of the steward or head-servant of
               a rich man who defrauded his master, and was, in consequence, excluded
               from his household. The servant anticipating such a punishment,
               says, "I am resolved what to do, that when I am <em>put out</em> of the
               stewardship, they may receive me into their houses." The case of
               Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, appears to be a similar one. He was
               guilty of fraud in procuring a large sum of money from Naaman, and
               of deliberate lying to his master, on account of which Elisha seems
               to have discarded him. 2 Kings v. 20-27. In this connection we
               may add that if a servant neglected the observance of any ceremonial
               rite, and was on that account excommunicated from the congregation
               of Israel, such excommunication excluded him also from the
               <i>family</i> of an Israelite. In other words he could
               be a <i>servant</i> no longer than he was an
               <i>Israelite</i>. To forfeit the latter
               <em>distinction</em> involved the forfeiture of the former
               <i>privilege</i>&#8212;which proves that it
               <em>was</em> a privilege.

            </p>
            <p>
               IV. THE HEBREW SERVANT COULD COMPEL HIS MASTER TO KEEP HIM.

            </p>
            <p>
               When the six years' contract had expired, if the servant <em>demanded</em>
               it, the law <em>obliged</em> the master to retain him permanently, however
               little he might need his services. Deut. xv. 12-17; Ex. xxi. 2-6.
               This shows that the system was framed to advance the interest and
               gratify the wishes of the servant quite as much as those of the
               master.

            </p>
            <p>
               V. SERVANTS WERE ADMITTED INTO COVENANT WITH GOD. Deut.
               xxix. 10-13.

            </p>
            <p>
               VI. THEY WERE GUESTS AT ALL NATIONAL AND FAMILY FESTIVALS
               Ex. xii. 43-44; Deut xii. 12, 18, xvi. 10-16.

            </p>
            <p>
               VII. THEY WERE STATEDLY INSTRUCTED IN MORALITY AND RELIGION.
               Deut. xxxi. 10-13; Josh. viii. 33-35; 2 Chron. xvii. 8-9, xxxv.
               3, and xxxiv. 30. Neh. viii. 7, 8.

            </p>
            <p>
               VIII. THEY WERE RELEASED FROM THEIR REGULAR LABOR NEARLY
               ONE HALF OF THE WHOLE TIME. During which they had their entire
               support, and the same instruction that was provided for the other members
               of the Hebrew community. The Law secured to them,

            </p>
            <p>
               1. <em>Every seventh year;</em> Lev. xxv. 3-6; thus giving to those who
               were servants during the entire period between the jubilees,
               <em>eight whole years</em>, (including the jubilee year,) of unbroken
               rest.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. <em>Every seventh day.</em> This in forty-two years, the eight being
               subtracted from the fifty, would amount to just <em>six years</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               3. <em>The three annual festivals.</em> Ex. xxiii. 17, xxxiv. 23.
               The <i>Passover</i>,
               which commenced on the 15th of the 1st month, and lasted seven
               days, Deut. xvi. 3, 8. The Pentecost, or Feast of Weeks, which
               began on the 6th day of the 3d month, and lasted seven days. Deut.
               xvi. 10, 11. The Feast of Tabernacles, which commenced on the
               15th of the 7th month, and lasted eight days. Deut. xvi. 13, 15; Lev.
               xxiii. 34-39. As all met in one place, much time would be spent on
               the journey. Cumbered caravans move slowly. After their arrival,
               a day or two would be requisite for divers preparations before the
               celebration, besides some time at the close of it, in preparations for return.
               If we assign three weeks to each festival&#8212;including the time
               spent on the journeys, and the delays before and after the celebration,
               together with the <em>festival week</em>, it will be a small allowance
               for the cessation of their regular labor. As there were three festivals in the
               year, the main body of the servants would be absent from their stated
               employments at least <em>nine weeks annually</em>, which
               would amount in forty-two years, subtracting the sabbaths, to six years and
               eighty-four days.

            </p>
            <p>
               4. <em>The new moons</em>. The Jewish year had twelve; Josephus says

               that the Jews always kept <em>two</em> days for the new moon. See Calmet
               on the Jewish Calendar, and Horne's Introduction; also 1 Sam. xx,
               18, 19, 27. This, in forty-two years, would be two years 280
               days.

            </p>
            <p>
               5. <em>The feast of trumpets</em>. On the first day of the seventh
               month, and of the civil year. Lev. xxiii. 24, 25.

            </p>
            <p>
               6. <em>The atonement day</em>. On the tenth of the seventh month Lev.
               xxiii. 27.

            </p>
            <p>
               These two feasts would consume not less than sixty-five days not
               reckoned above.

            </p>
            <p>
               Thus it appears that those who continued servants during the period
               between the jubilees, were by law released from their labor, TWENTY-THREE
               YEARS AND SIXTY-FOUR DAYS, OUT OF FIFTY YEARS, and those
               who remained a less time, in nearly the same proportion. In this calculation,
               besides making a donation of all the <em>fractions</em> to the objector,
               we have left out those numerous <em>local</em> festivals to which
               frequent allusion is made, Judg. xxi. 19; 1 Sam. ix. 12. 22. etc., and the
               various <em>family</em> festivals, such as at the weaning of children;
               at marriages; at sheep shearings; at circumcisions; at the making of
               covenants, &amp;c., to which reference is often made, as in 1 Sam, xx. 6. 28,
               29. Neither have we included the festivals instituted at a later period of the
               Jewish history&#8212;the feast of Purim, Esth. ix. 28, 29; and of the
               Dedication, which lasted eight days. John x. 22; 1 Mac. iv. 59.

            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, the Mosaic system secured to servants, an amount of time
               which, if distributed, would be almost ONE HALF OF THE DAYS IN EACH
               YEAR. Meanwhile, they were supported, and furnished with opportunities
               of instruction. If this time were distributed over <em>every day</em>, the
               servants would have to themselves nearly <em>one half of each day</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               The service of those Strangers who were <i>national</i>
               servants or tributaries, was regulated upon the same benevolent principle,
               and secured to them TWO-THIRDS of the whole year. "A month they were in
               Lebanon, and two months they were at home." 1 Kings, v. 13-15.
               Compared with 2 Chron. 11. 17-19, viii. 7-9; 1 Kings, ix 20. 22.
               The regulations under which the inhabitants of Gibeon, Chephirah,
               Beeroth and Kirjath-jearim, (afterwards called
               <i>Nethinims</i>) performed
               service for the Israelites, must have secured to them nearly the whole of
               their time. If, as is probable, they served in courses corresponding
               to those of their priests whom they assisted, they were in actual service
               less than one month annually.

            </p>
            <p>
               IX. THE SERVANT WAS PROTECTED BY LAW EQUALLY WITH THE
               OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY

            <p>
               Proof.&#8212;"Judge righteously between every man and his brother
               and THE STRANGER THAT IS WITH HIM." "Ye shall not RESPECT PERSONS
               in judgment, but ye shall hear the SMALL as well as the great."
               Deut. i. 16, 19. Also Lev. xix. 15. xxiv. 22. "Ye shall have one
               manner of law as well for the STRANGER, as for one of your own country."
               So Num. xv. 29. "Ye shall have ONE LAW for him that sinneth
               through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of
               Israel and for the STRANGER that sojourneth among them." Deut.

               by Rabbi Leeser, we find the following.&#8212;Sec. 165.

            </p>
            <p>
               "Question. Does holy writ any where make a difference between the Israelite
               and the other who is no Israelite, in those laws and prohibitions which forbid
               us the <em>committal of any thing against our fellow men?</em>"

            </p>
            <p>
               "Answer. No where we do find a trace of such a difference. See Lev. xix.

               "God says thou shalt not murder, <em>steal</em>, cheat, &amp;c. In every
               place the action <em>itself</em> is prohibited as being an abomination to
               God <em>without respect to the <b>persons</b>

            </p>

               X. THE MOSAIC SYSTEM ENJOINED THE GREATEST AFFECTION AND
               KINDNESS TOWARDS SERVANTS, FOREIGN AS WELL AS JEWISH.

            </p>
            <p>
               "The stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born
               among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself." Lev. xix. 34.
               "For the Lord your God * * REGARDETH NOT PERSONS. He doth
               execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and LOVETH THE
               STRANGER, in giving him food and raiment, LOVE YE THEREFORE THE
               STRANGER." Deut. x. 17, 19. "Thou shalt neither vex a STRANGER
               nor oppress him." Ex. xxii. 21. "Thou shalt not oppress a
               STRANGER, for ye know the heart of a stranger." Ex. xxiii. 9.
               "If thy brother be waxen poor thou shalt relieve him, yea, though he
               be a STRANGER or a sojourner, that he may live with thee, take thou no
               usury of him or increase, but fear thy God." Lev. xxv. 35, 36.
               Could this same stranger be taken by one that feared his God, and
               held as a slave, and robbed of time, earnings, and all his rights?

            </p>
            <p>
               XI. SERVANTS WERE PLACED UPON A LEVEL WITH THEIR MASTERS IN
               ALL CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS RIGHTS. Num. xv. 15, 16, 29; ix. 14;
               Deut. i. 16, 17; Lev. xxiv. 22. To these may be added that numerous
               class of passages which represents God as regarding <em>alike</em> the
               natural rights of <em>all</em> men, and making for all an
               <em>equal</em> provision. Such

               as, 2 Chron. xix. 7; Prov. xxiv. 23, xxviii. 21; Job. xxxiv. 19,
               2 Sam. xiv. 14; Acts x. 35; Eph. vi. 9.

            </p>
            <p>
               Finally&#8212;With such watchful jealousy did the Mosaic Institutes
               guard the <em>rights</em> of servants, as to make the mere fact of a
               servant's escape from his master presumptive evidence that his master had
               <em>oppressed</em> him; and on that presumption, annulled his master's
               authority over him, gave him license to go wherever he pleased, and commanded
               all to protect him. Deut. xxiii. 15, 16. As this regulation will be examined
               under a subsequent head, where its full discussion more appropriately
               belongs, we notice it here merely to point out its bearings on
               the topic under consideration.

            </p>
            <p>
               THESE ARE REGULATIONS OF THAT MOSAIC SYSTEM WHICH IS CLAIMED
               BY SLAVEHOLDERS AS THE PROTOTYPE OF AMERICAN SLAVERY.

               II. WERE PERSONS MADE SERVANTS AGAINST THEIR WILLS?

            </h3>
            <p>
               We argue that they became servants of <em>their own accord,</em> because,

            </p>
            <p>
               I. TO BECOME A SERVANT WAS TO BECOME A PROSELYTE. Whoever
               of the strangers became a servant, he was required to abjure idolatry,
               to enter into covenant with God<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN15"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN15"></a>, be
               circumcised in token of it, be
               bound to keep the Sabbath, the Passover, the Pentecost, and the Feast

               of Tabernacles, and to receive instruction in the moral and ceremonial
               law. Were the servants <em>forced</em> through all these processes? Was
               the renunciation of idolatry <i>compulsory</i>? Were they
               <em>dragged</em> into covenant with God? Were they seized and
               circumcised by <em>main strength</em>? Were they <em>compelled</em>
               mechanically to chew and swallow
               the flesh of the Paschal lamb, while they abhorred the institution,
               spurned the laws that enjoined it, detested its author and its executors,
               and instead of rejoicing in the deliverance which it commemorated,
               bewailed it as a calamity, and cursed the day of its consummation?
               Were they <em>driven</em> from all parts of the land three times in the
               year to the annual festivals? Were they drugged with instruction which they
               nauseated? Were they goaded through a round of ceremonies, to
               them senseless and disgusting mummeries; and drilled into the tactics
               of a creed rank with loathed abominations? We repeat it, to become
               a <i>servant</i>, was to become a
               <i>proselyte</i>. Did God authorize his
               people to make proselytes at the point of the bayonet? by the terror of
               pains and penalties? by converting men into
               <i>merchandise?</i> Were <em>proselyte
                  and chattel</em> synonymes in the Divine vocabulary? Must a man
               be sunk to a <i>thing</i> before taken into covenant with
               God? Was this the stipulated condition of adoption? the sure and sacred
               passport to the communion of the saints?

            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN15"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN15">A</a>: Maimonides, a
               contemporary with Jarchi, and who stands with him at the
               head of Jewish writers, gives the following testimony on this point:

            </p>
            <p>
               "Whether a servant be born in the power of an Israelite, or whether he be
               purchased from the heathen, the master is to bring them both into the
               covenant.

            </p>
            <p>
               "But he that is in the <i>house</i> is entered on the
               eighth day, and he that is bought with money, on the day on which his master
               receives him, unless the slave be <em>unwilling</em>. For if the master
               receive a grown slave, and he be <em>unwilling</em>,
               his master is to bear with him, to seek to win him over by instruction,
               and by love and kindness, for one year. After which, should he
               <em>refuse</em> so long, it is forbidden to keep him longer than a year.
               And the master must send him back to the strangers from whence he came. For
               the God of Jacob will not accept any other than the worship of a
               <em>willing</em> heart."&#8212;Maimon, Hilcoth Miloth,
               Chap. 1, Sec. 8.

            <p>
               The ancient Jewish Doctors assert that the servant from the Strangers who at
               the close of his probationary year, refused to adopt the Jewish religion and
               was on that account sent back to his own people, received a
               <em>full compensation</em> for his services, besides the payment of his
               expenses. But that <em>postponement</em> of the circumcision
               of the foreign servant for a year (<em>or even at all</em> after he had
               entered the family of an Israelite) of which the Mishnic doctors speak, seems
               to have been <em>a mere usage</em>. We find nothing of it in the
               regulations of the Mosaic system. Circumcision was manifestly a rite strictly
               <i>initiatory</i>. Whether it was a rite merely
               <i>national</i> or <i>spiritual</i>,
               or <em>both</em>, comes not within the scope of this inquiry.

               II. THE SURRENDER OF FUGITIVE SERVANTS TO THEIR MASTERS
               WAS PROHIBITED. "Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant
               which is escaped from his master unto thee. He shall dwell with
               thee, even among you, in that place which he shall choose, in one of
               thy gates where it liketh him best; thou shalt not oppress him." Deut.
               xxiii. 15, 16.

            </p>
            <p>
               As though God had said, "To deliver him up would be to recognize
               the <i>right</i> of the master to hold him; his
               <em>fleeing</em> shows his <em>choice</em>, proclaims
               his wrongs and his title to protection; you shall not force him
               back and thus recognize the <i>right</i> of the master to
               hold him in such a condition as induces him to flee to others for protection."
               It may be said that this command referred only to the servants of
               <i>heathen</i>
               masters in the surrounding nations. We answer: the terms of the
               command are unlimited. But the objection, if valid, would merely
               shift the pressure of the difficulty to another point. Did God require
               them to protect the <i>free choice</i> of a
               <em>single</em> servant from the heathen,
               and yet <em>authorize</em> the same persons, to crush the free choice of
               <em>thousands</em> of servants from the heathen? Suppose a case. A
               <em>foreign</em> servant escapes to the Israelites; God says, "He shall
               dwell with thee, in that place which <em>he shall choose</em>, in one of
               thy gates where it
               <em>liketh him</em> best." Now, suppose this same servant, instead of
               coming into Israel of his own accord, had been <em>dragged</em> in by
               some kidnapper, who bought him of his master, and forced him into a condition
               against his will; would He who forbade such treatment of the stranger,
               who <em>voluntarily</em> came into the land, sanction the same treatment
               of the <em>same person</em>, provided in addition to this last outrage,
               the previous one had been committed of forcing him into the nation
               against his will? To commit violence on the free choice of a foreign
               servant is forsooth a horrible enormity, provided you <em>begin</em> the
               violence <em>after</em> he has come among you. But if you commit the
               first act on the <em>other side of the line</em>; if you begin the
               outrage by buying him from a third person against his will, and then tear
               him from home, drag him across the line into the land of Israel, and hold him
               as a slave&#8212;ah! that alters the case, and you may perpetrate the violence
               now with impunity! Would <em>greater</em> favor have been shown to this
               new comer than to the old residents&#8212;those who had been servants in
               Jewish families perhaps for a generation? Were the Israelites commanded
               to exercise towards <em>him</em>, uncircumcised and out of the covenant,
               a justice and kindness denied to the multitudes who <em>were</em>
               circumcised, and <em>within</em> the covenant? But, the objector finds
               small gain to his argument on the supposition that the covenant respected
               merely the fugitives from the surrounding nations, while it left the
               servants of the Israelites in a condition against their wills. In that
               case, the surrounding nations would adopt retaliatory measures, and
               become so many asylums for Jewish fugitives. As these nations
               were not only on every side of them, but in their midst, such a
               proclamation would have been an effectual lure to men whose condition
               was a constant counteraction of will. Besides the same command
               which protected the servant from the power of his foreign
               <i>master</i>, protected him equally from the power of an
               <i>Israelite</i>. It was not, merely "Thou shalt not
               deliver him unto his <i>master</i>," but "he shall
               dwell with thee, in that place which <em>he shall choose</em> in one of
               thy gates where it liketh <em>him</em> best." Every Israelite was
               forbidden to put him in any condition <em>against his will</em>. What was
               this but a proclamation, that all who <em>chose</em> to live in the land
               and obey the laws, were left to their own free will, to dispose of their
               services at such a rate, to such persons, and in such places as they pleased?
               Besides, grant that this command prohibited the sending back of
               <em>foreign</em> servants only, there was no law requiring the return
               of servants who had escaped from the <em>Israelites</em>.
               <i>Property</i> lost, and
               <i>cattle</i> escaped, they were required
               to return, but not escaped <i>servants</i>. These verses
               contain, 1st, a command,

               "Thou shalt not deliver," &amp;c., 2d. a declaration of the fugitive's
               right of <i>free choice</i>, and of God's will that he
               should exercise it at his own discretion; and 3d, a command guarding this
               right, namely, "Thou shalt not oppress him," as though God had said, "If you
               restrain him from exercising his <em>own choice</em>, as to the place and
               condition of his residence, it is <em>oppression</em>, and shall not be
               tolerated."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN16"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN16"></a></p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN16"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN16">A</a>: Perhaps it may be objected that this
               view of Deut. xxiii. 15, 16, makes nonsense
               of Ex. xxi. 27, which provides that if a man strikes out his servant's tooth
               he shall let him go free. Small favor indeed if the servant might set himself
               free whenever he pleased! Answer&#8212;The former passage might remove the
               servant from the master's <em>authority</em>, without annulling the
               master's legal claims upon the servant, if he had paid him in advance and
               had not received from him an equivalent, and this equally, whether his master
               were a Jew or a Gentile. The latter passage, "He shall let him go free
               <em>for his tooth's sake,"</em> not only freed
               the servant from the master's authority, but also from any pecuniary claim
               which the master might have on account of having paid his wages in advance;
               and this <em>as a compensation</em>, for the loss of a tooth.
            </p>
            <p>
               III. THE SERVANTS HAD PECULIAR OPPORTUNITIES AND FACILITIES FOR
               ESCAPE. Three times every year, all the males over twelve years,
               were required to attend the national feasts. They were thus absent
               from their homes not less than three weeks at each time, making nine
               weeks annually. As these caravans moved over the country, were
               there military scouts lining the way, to intercept deserters?&#8212;a
               corporal's guard at each pass of the mountains, sentinels pacing the hilltops,
               and light-horse scouring the defiles? The Israelites must have
               had some safe contrivance for taking their "<i>slaves</i>"
               three times in a year to Jerusalem and back. When a body of slaves is moved
               any distance in our <em>republic</em>, they are handcuffed and chained
               together, to keep them from running away, or beating their drivers' brains
               out. Was this the <em>Mosaic</em> plan, or an improvement introduced by
               Samuel, or was it left for the wisdom of Solomon? The usage, doubtless,
               claims a paternity not less venerable and biblical! Perhaps they were
               lashed upon camels, and transported in bundles, or caged up and trundled
               on wheels to and fro, and while at the Holy City, "lodged in jail
               for safe keeping," the Sanhedrim appointing special religious services
               for their benefit, and their "drivers" officiating at "ORAL instruction."
               Meanwhile, what became of the sturdy <em>handmaids</em> left at home? What
               hindered them from stalking off in a body? Perhaps the Israelitish
               matrons stood sentry in rotation round the kitchens, while the young
               ladies scoured the country, as mounted rangers, picking up stragglers
               by day, and patrolled the streets, keeping a sharp look-out at night!

               IV. WILFUL NEGLECT OF CEREMONIAL RITES DISSOLVED THE RELATION.

            </p>
            <p>
               Suppose the servants from the heathen had, upon entering Jewish
               families, refused circumcision; if <i>slaves</i>, how
               simple the process of emancipation! Their <em>refusal</em> did the job.
               Or, suppose they had refused to attend the annual feasts, or had eaten
               leavened bread during the Passover, or compounded the ingredients of the
               anointing oil, or had touched a dead body, a bone, or a grave, or in any way
               had contracted ceremonial uncleanness, and refused to be cleansed with the
               "water of separation," they would have been "cut off from the people;"
               <i>excommunicated</i>. Ex. xii. 19; xxx. 33; Num. xix. 16.

            </p>
            <p>
               V. SERVANTS OF THE PATRIARCHS NECESSARILY VOLUNTARY.

            </p>
            <p>
               Abraham's servants are an illustration. At one time he had three
               hundred and eighteen <em>young men</em> "born in his house," and many more
               <em>not</em> born in his house. His servants of all ages were probably
               MANY THOUSANDS. How did Abraham and Sarah contrive to hold fast so
               many thousand servants against their wills? The most natural supposition
               is that the Patriarch and his wife "took turns" in surrounding
               them! The neighboring tribes, instead of constituting a picket
               guard to hem in his servants, would have been far more likely to
               sweep them and him into captivity, as they did Lot and his household.
               Besides, there was neither "constitution" nor "compact," to send
               back Abraham's fugitives, nor a truckling police to pounce upon them,
               nor gentlemen-kidnappers, suing for his patronage, volunteering to
               howl on their track, boasting their blood-hound scent, and pledging
               their honour to hunt down and deliver up, provided they had a description
               of the "flesh-marks," and were suitably stimulated by pieces of
               silver.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN17"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN17"></a> Abraham seems also to have been sadly deficient in all the

               auxiliaries of family government, such as stocks, hand-cuffs, foot-chains,
               yokes, gags, and thumb-screws. His destitution of these patriarchal
               indispensables is the more afflicting, since he faithfully trained "his
               household to do justice and judgment," though so deplorably destitute
               of the needful aids.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN17"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN17">A</a>: The following is a standing newspaper
               advertisement of one of these professional
               man-catchers, a member of the New York bar, who coolly plies his
               trade in the commercial emporium, sustained by the complacent greetings and

            <p>
               Probably Job had even more servants than Abraham. See Job. i. 3,
               14-19, and xlii. 12. That his thousands of servants staid with him
               entirely of their own accord, is proved by the <em>fact</em> of their
               staying with him. Suppose they had wished to quit his service, and so the
               whole army had filed off before him in full retreat, how could the patriarch
               have brought them to halt? Doubtless with his wife, seven sons, and
               three daughters for allies, he would have soon out-flanked the fugitive
               host and dragged each of them back to his wonted chain and staple.

            </p>
            <p>
               But the impossibility of Job's servants being held against their wills,
               is not the only proof of their voluntary condition. We have his own
               explicit testimony that he had not "withheld from the poor their
               <em>desire</em>." Job. xxxi. 16. Of course he could hardly have made
               them live with him, and forced them to work for him against
               <em>their desire</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               When Isaac sojourned in the country of the Philistines he "had
               <em>great store</em> of servants." And we have his testimony that the
               Philistines hated him, added to that of inspiration that they "envied" him.
               Of course they would hardly volunteer to organize patroles and committees
               of vigilance to keep his servants from running away, and to
               drive back all who were found beyond the limits of his plantation without
               a "pass!" If the thousands of Isaac's servants were held against
               their wills, who held them?

            </p>
            <p>
               The servants of the Jews, during the building of the wall of Jerusalem,
               under Nehemiah, may be included under this head. That they
               remained with their masters of their own accord, we argue from the fact,
               that the circumstances of the Jews made it impossible for them to
               <em>compel</em> their residence and service. They were few in number,
               without resources, defensive fortifications, or munitions of war, and
               surrounded withal by a host of foes, scoffing at their feebleness and inviting
               desertion from their ranks. Yet so far from the Jews attempting in any way to
               restrain their

               servants, or resorting to precautions to prevent escape, they put arms into
               their hands, and enrolled them as a night-guard, for the defence of the
               city. By cheerfully engaging in this service and in labor by day, when
               with entire ease they might all have left their masters, marched over to
               the enemy, and been received with shoutings, the servants testified that
               their condition was one of <em>their own choice</em>, and that they
               regarded their own interests as inseparably identified with those of their
               masters. Neh. iv. 23.

            </p>
            <p>
               VI. NO INSTANCES OF ISRAELITISH MASTERS SELLING SERVANTS.
               Neither Abraham nor Isaac seem ever to have sold one, though they
               had "great store of servants." Jacob was himself a servant in the family
               of Laban twenty-one years. He had afterward a large number of
               servants. Joseph invited him to come into Egypt, and to bring all that
               he had with him&#8212;"thou and thy children, and thy children's children,
               and thy flocks and thy herds, and ALL THAT THOU HAST." Gen. xlv. 10.
               Jacob took his flocks and herds but <em>no servants</em>. Yet we are
               told that Jacob "took his journey with <em>all that he had</em>."
               Gen. xlvi. 1. And after
               his arrival in Egypt, Joseph said to Pharaoh "my father, and my brethren,
               and their flocks, and their herds and <em>all that they have</em>,
               are come." Gen. xlvii. 1. The servants doubtless, served under their
               <em>own contracts</em>, and when Jacob went into Egypt, they
               <em>chose</em> to stay in their own country.

            </p>
            <p>
               The government might sell <em>thieves</em>, if they had no property, until
               their services had made good the injury, and paid the legal fine. Ex. xxii.
               3. But <i>masters</i> seem to have had no power to sell
               their <i>servants</i>. To give the master a
               <em>right</em> to sell his servant, would annihilate the servant's
               right of choice in his own disposal; but says the objector, "to give the
               master a right to <em>buy</em> a servant, equally annihilates the
               servant's <i>right of choice</i>." Answer. It is one
               thing to have a right to buy a man, and a quite another thing to have a right
               to buy him of <em>another</em> man.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN18"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN18"></a></p>

               Though servants were not bought of their masters, yet young females
               were bought of their <em>fathers</em>. But their purchase as
               <em>servants</em> was their betrothal as WIVES. Ex. xxi. 7, 8. "If a man
               sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the
               men-servants do. If she please not her master WHO HATH BETROTHED HER TO

               VII. VOLUNTARY SERVANTS FROM THE STRANGERS.

            </p>
            <p>
               We infer that <em>all</em> the servants from the Strangers were voluntary
               in becoming such, since we have direct testimony that some of them were
               so. "Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy,
               whether he be of thy brethren, OR OF THY STRANGERS that are in thy land
               within thy gates." Deut. xxiv. 14. We learn from this that some of the
               servants, which the Israelites obtained from the strangers were procured
               by presenting the inducement of <em>wages</em> to their
               <i>free choice</i>, thus recognizing
               their right to sell their services to others, or not, at their own
               pleasure. Did the Israelites, when they went among the heathen to
               procure servants, take money in one hand and ropes in the other? Did
               they <em>ask</em> one man to engage in their service, and
               <em>drag</em> along with them the next that they met, in spite of his
               struggles. Did they knock for admission
               at one door and break down the next? Did they go through one
               village with friendly salutations and respectful demeanor, and with the
               air of those soliciting favors, offer wages to the inhabitants as an
               inducement to engage in their service&#8212;while they sent on their agents to
               prowl through the next, with a kidnapping posse at their heels, to tear
               from their homes as many as they could get within their clutches?

            </p>
            <p>
               VIII. HEBREW SERVANTS VOLUNTARY.

            </p>
            <p>
               We infer that the Hebrew
               servant was voluntary in COMMENCING his service, because he was preeminently
               so IN CONTINUING it. If, at the year of release, it was the
               servant's <em>choice</em> to remain with his master, the law required
               his ear to be bored by the judges of the land, thus making it impossible for
               him to be held against his will. Yea more, his master was
               <em>compelled</em> to keep him, however much he might wish to get rid of
               him.

            </p>
            <p>
               IX. THE MANNER OF PROCURING SERVANTS, AN APPEAL TO CHOICE.

            </p>
            <p>
               The Israelites were commanded to offer them a suitable inducement,
               and then leave them to decide. They might neither seize them by
               <em>force</em>, nor frighten them by <em>threats</em>, nor wheedle
               them by false pretences, nor <em>borrow</em> them, nor <em>beg</em>
               them; but they were commanded to BUY them<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN20"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN20"></a>&#8212;that is, they were to recognize the
               <em>right</em> of the individuals to <em>dispose</em> of their own
               services, and their right to <em>refuse all offers</em>,

               and thus oblige those who made them, <em>to do their own work</em>.
               Suppose all, with one accord, had <em>refused</em> to become servants,
               what provision did the Mosaic law make for such an emergency? NONE.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN20"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN20">A</a>: The case
               of thieves, whose services were sold until they had earned enough to make
               restitution to the person wronged, and to pay the legal penalty,
               <em>stands by itself</em>, and has nothing to do with the condition of
               servants.
            </p>
            <p>
               X. INCIDENTAL CORROBORATIVES. Various incidental expressions
               corroborate the idea that servants became such by their own contract.
               Job. xli. 4, is an illustration, "Will he (Leviathan) make a COVENANT
               with thee? wilt thou take him for a SERVANT forever?" Isa. xiv. 1, 2
               is also an illustration. "The strangers shall be joined with them (the
               Israelites) and <em>they shall</em> CLEAVE to the house of Jacob, and
               the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord, for servants
               and handmaids."

            </p>
            <p>
               The transaction which made the Egyptians the SERVANTS OF
               PHARAOH was voluntary throughout. See Gen. xlvii. 18-26. Of
               their own accord they came to Joseph and said, "There is not aught
               left but our <em>bodies</em> and our lands; <em>buy</em> us;" then in
               the 25th verse, "We will be Pharaoh's servants." To these it may be added,
               that the sacrifices and offerings which ALL were required to present, were to
               be made VOLUNTARILY. Lev. i. 2. 3.

            </p>
            <p>
               The pertinence and point of our Lord's declaration in Luke xvi. 13,
               is destroyed on the supposition that servants did not become such by
               <em>their own choice</em>. "No servant can serve two masters: for either
               he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one
               and despise the other." Let it be kept in mind, that our Lord was a
               <em>Jew</em>. The lost sheep of the house of Israel were his flock.
               Wherever he went, they were around him: whenever he spake, they were his
               auditors. His public preaching and his private teaching and conversation,
               were full of references to their own institutions, laws and usages,
               and of illustrations drawn from them. In the verse quoted, he illustrates
               the impossibility of their making choice of God as their portion,
               and becoming his servants, while they chose the world, and were
               <em>its</em> servants. To make this clear, he refers to one of their own
               institutions, that of <em>domestic service</em>, with which, in all its
               relations, incidents and usages, they were perfectly familiar. He reminds them
               of the well-known impossibility of any person being the servant of two
               masters, and declares the sole ground of that impossibility to be, the fact
               that the servant <em>chooses</em> the service of the one, and
               <em>spurns</em> that of the other. "He shall <em>hold to</em> the one
               and <em>despise</em> (reject) the other." As
               though our Lord had said, "No one can become the servant of another,
               when his will revolts from his service, and when the conditions
               of it tend to make him hate the man." Since the fact that the servant
               <em>spurns</em> one of two masters, makes it impossible for him to serve
               <em>that one</em>,

               if he spurned <em>both</em> it would make it impossible for him to serve
               <em>either</em>. So, also, if the fact that an individual did not
               "hold to" or choose the service of another, proves that he could not become
               his servant, then the question, whether or not he should become the servant
               of another was suspended on <em>his own will</em>. Further, the
               phraseology of the passage shows that the <em>choice</em> of the servant
               decided the question. "He will HOLD TO the one,"&#8212;hence there is no
               difficulty in the way of his serving <em>him</em>; but "no servant can
               serve" a master whom he does not "<em>hold to</em>," or
               <em>cleave</em> to, whose service he does not <em>choose</em>. This
               is the sole ground of the impossibility asserted by our Lord.

            </p>
            <p>
               The last clause of the verse furnishes an application of the principle
               asserted in the former part, "Ye cannot serve God and mammon."
               Now in what does the impossibility of serving both God and the
               world consist? Solely in the fact that the will which chooses the one
               refuses the other, and the affections which "hold to" the one, reject
               the other. Thus the question, Which of the two is to be served, is
               suspended alone upon the <em>choice</em> of the individual.

            </p>
            <p>
               XI. RICH STRANGERS DID NOT BECOME SERVANTS. Indeed, so far were
               they from becoming servants themselves, that they bought and held
               Jewish servants. Lev. xxv. 47. Since <em>rich</em> strangers did not
               become servants to the Israelites, we infer that those who <em>did</em>,
               became such not because they were <i>strangers</i>, but
               because they were <em>poor</em>,&#8212;not because, on account of their
               being heathen, they were <em>compelled by force</em>
               to become servants, but because, on account of their <em>poverty</em>,
               they <em>chose</em> to become servants to better their condition.

            </p>
            <p>
               XII. INSTANCES OF VOLUNTARY SERVANTS. Mention is often made
               of persons becoming servants who were manifestly VOLUNTARY.
               As the Prophet Elisha. 1 Kings xix. 21; 2 Kings iii. 11. Elijah
               was his <i>master</i>. 2 Kings ii. 5. The word translated
               master, is the same that is so rendered in almost every instance where
               masters are spoken of under the Mosaic and patriarchal systems. Moses was the
               servant of Jethro. Ex. iii. 1; iv. 10. Joshua was the servant of
               Moses. Ex. xxxiii. 11. Num. xi. 28. Jacob was the servant of Laban.
               Gen. xxix. 18-27. See also the case of the Gibeonites who
               <em>voluntarily</em> became servants to the Israelites and afterwards
               performed service for the "house of God" throughout the subsequent Jewish
               history, were incorporate with the Israelites, registered in the genealogies,
               and manifestly of their own accord remained with them, and
               "<i>clave</i>" to them. Neh. x. 28, 29; xi. 3;
               Ez. vii. 7.

            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, in all the regulations respecting servants and their service,
               no form of expression is employed from which it could be inferred, that

               servants were made such, and held in that condition by force. Add to
               this the entire absence of all the machinery, appurtenances and incidents
               of <em>compulsion</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               Voluntary service on the part of servants would have been in keeping with
               regulations which abounded in the Mosaic system and sustained
               by a multitude of analogies. Compulsory service on the other
               hand, could have harmonized with nothing, and would have been the
               solitary disturbing force, marring its design, counteracting its tendencies,
               and confusing and falsifying its types. The directions given to
               regulate the performance of service for the <em>public</em>, lay great
               stress on the <em>willingness</em> of those employed to perform it. For
               the spirit and usages that obtained under the Mosaic system in this respect,
               see 1 Chron. xxviii. 21; Ex. xxxv. 5, 21, 22, 29; 1 Chron. xxix. 5, 6, 9, 14,
               17; Ex. xxv. 2; Judges v. 2; Lev. xxii. 29; 2 Chron. xxxv. 8; Ezra i. 6;
               Ex. xxxv; Neh. xi. 2.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN21"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN21"></a></p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN21"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN21">A</a>: We should naturally infer
               that the directions which regulated the rendering of service to individuals,
               would proceed upon the same principle in this respect with those which
               regulated the rendering of service to the <em>public</em>. Otherwise
               the Mosaic system, instead of constituting in its different parts a harmonious
               <em>whole</em>, would be divided against itself; its principles
               counteracting and nullifying each other.
            </p>
            <p>
               Again, the voluntariness of servants is a natural inference from
               the fact that the Hebrew word
               <i>eb&#275;dh,</i> uniformly rendered
               <i>servant</i>, is applied to a great variety of classes
               and descriptions of persons under the patriarchal and Jewish dispensations,
               <em>all of whom</em> were voluntary and most of them eminently so. For
               instance, it is applied to persons rendering acts of <em>worship</em>
               about seventy times, whereas it is applied to
               <i>servants</i> not more than half that number of times.

            </p>
            <p>
               To this we may add, that the illustrations drawn from the condition
               and service of <i>servants</i> and the ideas which the
               term servant is employed to convey when applied figuratively to moral
               subjects would, in most
               instances, lose all their force, and often become absurdities if the will
               of the servant <em>resisted</em> his service, and he performed it only
               by <em>compulsion</em>. Many passages will at once occur to those who are
               familiar with the Bible. We give a single example. "<em>To whom YE YIELD
                  YOURSELVES servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey.</em>"
               Rom. vi. 16. It would hardly be possible to assert the voluntariness of
               servants more strongly in a direct proposition than it is here asserted by
               implication.

               III. WERE SERVANTS FORCED TO WORK WITHOUT PAY

            </h3>
            <p>
               As the servants became and continued such of <em>their own accord</em>, it
               would be no small marvel if they <em>chose</em> to work without pay. Their
               becoming servants, pre-supposes <em>compensation</em> as a motive. That
               they <em>were paid</em> for their labor, we argue.

            </p>
            <p>
               1. BECAUSE GOD REBUKED THE USING OF SERVICE WITHOUT
               WAGES. "Wo unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness,
               and his chambers by wrong; THAT USETH HIS NEIGHBOR'S SERVICE
               WITHOUT WAGES, AND GIVETH HIM NOT FOR HIS WORK." Jer. xxii.
               13. The Hebrew word <i>re&#257;</i>,
               translated <i>neighbor</i>, means any one
               with whom we have to do&#8212;all descriptions of persons, even those who
               prosecute us in lawsuits, and enemies while in the act of fighting
               us&#8212;"As when a man riseth against his NEIGHBOR and slayeth him."
               Deut. xxii. 26. "Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what
               to do in the end thereof, when thy NEIGHBOR hath put thee to shame."
               Prov. xxv. 8. "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy NEIGHBOR."
               Ex. xx. 16. "If a man come presumptuously upon his
               NEIGHBOR to slay him with guile." Ex. xxi. 14, &amp;c. The doctrine
               plainly inculcated in this passage is, that every man's labor, or "service,"
               being his own property, he is entitled to the profit of it, and that
               for another to "use" it without paying him the value of it, is
               "unrighteousness." The last clause of the verse "and giveth him not for
               his work," reaffirms the same principle, that every man is to be
               <em>paid</em> for "his work." In the context, the prophet contrasts the
               unrighteousness of those who used the labor of others without pay, with the
               justice and equity practiced by their patriarchal ancestor toward the poor.
               "Did not thy father eat and drink and <em>do judgment and justice</em>,
               and then it was well with him. He <em>judged the cause of the poor and
                  needy</em>; then it was well with him. But thine eyes and thine heart are
               not but for thy <em>covetousness</em>, and for to shed innocent blood,
               and for <em>oppression</em>, and for violence to do it." Jer. xxii.
               15, 16. 17.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN22"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN22"></a></p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN22"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN22">A</a>: Paul lays down the same principle in
               the form of a precept "Masters give unto your servants that which is JUST and
               EQUAL." Col. iv. 1. Thus not only asserting the <em>right</em> of the
               servant to an equivalent for his labor, and the duty of the master to render
               it, but condemning all those relations between master and servant which were
               not founded upon justice and equality of rights. The apostle James enforces
               the same principle. "Behold, the hire of the laborers, who have reaped down
               your fields, which is of you kept back <em>by fraud</em>, crieth."
               James v. 4. As though he had said, "wages are the <em>right</em> of
               laborers; those who work for you have a just claim on you for
               <em>pay</em>; this you refuse to render, and thus <em>defraud</em>
               them by keeping from them what <em>belongs</em> to them." See also Mal.

               II. GOD TESTIFIES THAT IN OUR DUTY TO OUR FELLOW MEN, ALL
               THE LAW AND THE PROPHETS HANG UPON THIS COMMAND, "THOU
               SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF." Our Savior, in giving this
               command, quoted <i>verbatim</i> one of the laws of the
               Mosaic system. Lev. xix. 18. In the 34th verse of the same chapter, Moses
               applies this law to the treatment of strangers, "The stranger that dwelleth
               with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and THOU SHALT LOVE
               HIM AS THYSELF." If it be loving others as ourselves, to make them
               work for us without pay; to rob them of food and clothing also,
               would be a stronger illustration still of the law of love!
               <em>Super</em>-disinterested benevolence! And if it be doing unto others
               as we would have them do to us, to make them work for <em>our own</em>
               good alone, Paul should be called to order for his hard sayings against human
               nature, especially for that libellous matter in Eph. v. 29, "No man ever yet
               hated his own flesh, but nourisheth it and cherisheth it."

            </p>
            <p>
               III. SERVANTS WERE OFTEN WEALTHY. As persons became servants FROM POVERTY,
               we argue that they were compensated, since they frequently owned property,
               and sometimes a large amount. Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, gave David
               "Two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred
               of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine." 2 Sam. xvi. 1. The extent of his
               possessions can be inferred from the fact, that though the father of fifteen
               sons, he had twenty servants. In Lev. xxv. 47-49, where a servant, reduced to
               poverty, sold himself, it is declared that he may be <em>redeemed,</em>
               either by his kindred, or by HIMSELF. Having been forced to sell himself from
               poverty, he must have acquired considerable property <em>after</em> he
               became a servant. If it had not been common for servants to acquire property
               over which they had the control, the servant of Elisha would hardly have
               ventured to take a large sum of money, (nearly
               $3000<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN23"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN23"></a>) from Naaman, 2 Kings v. 22, 23. As it was procured
               by deceit, he wished to conceal the means used in getting it; but if servants
               could "own nothing, nor acquire anything," to embark in such an enterprise
               would have been consummate stupidity. The fact of having in his possession
               two talents of silver, would of itself convict him of
               theft.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN24"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN24"></a> But
               since it

               was common for servants to own property, he might have it, and invest
               or use it, without attracting special attention, and that consideration
               alone would have been a strong motive to the act. His master,
               though he rebuked him for using such means to get the money, not
               only does not take it from him, but seems to expect that he would invest
               it in real estate, and cattle, and would procure servants with it.
               2 Kings v. 26. We find the servant of Saul having money, and relieving
               his master in an emergency. 1 Sam. ix. 8. Arza, the servant
               of Elah, was the <em>owner of a house</em>. That it was somewhat
               magnificent, would be a natural inference from its being a resort of the
               king. 1 Kings xvi. 9. When Jacob became the servant of Laban, it
               was evidently from poverty, yet Laban said to him, Tell me "what
               shall thy <em>wages</em> be?" After Jacob had been his servant for ten
               years, he proposed to set up for himself, but Laban said "Appoint me thy
               wages and I will give it," and he paid him his price. During the
               twenty years that Jacob was a servant, he always worked for wages
               and at his own price. Gen. xxix. 15, 18; xxx. 28-33. The case
               of the Gibeonites, who, after becoming servants, still occupied their
               cities, and remained in many respects, a distinct people for
               centuries;<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN25"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN25"></a> and that of the 150,000 Canaanites,
               the <i>servants</i> of Solomon, who worked out their
               "tribute of bond-service" in levies, periodically relieving

               each other, are additional illustrations of independence in the
               acquisition and ownership of property.

               upon the <em>relative</em> value of that sum, <em>then</em> and now,

                  things</em> as will make detection difficult. No doubt they steal now
               and then, and a gaping marvel would it be if they did not. Why should they
               not follow in the footsteps of their masters and mistresses? Dull scholars
               indeed! if, after so many lessons from <em>proficients</em> in the art,
               who drive the business by <em>wholesale</em>, they should not
               occasionally copy their betters, fall into the <em>fashion</em>, and try
               their hand in a small way, at a practice which is the <em>only permanent

               pattern set before them in the daily vocation of "Honorables" and

               President Jefferson's testimony. In his Notes on Virginia, pp. 207-8,
               speaking of slaves, he says, "That disposition to theft with which they have
               been branded, must be ascribed to their <em>situation</em>, and not to any
               special depravity of the moral sense. It is a problem which I give the master
               to solve, whether the religious precepts against the violation of property
               were not framed for HIM as well as for his slave&#8212;and whether the slave
               may not as justifiably take a <em>little</em> from one who has taken ALL

               for the service of the tabernacle, had their own houses and cities and
               "dwelt every one in his own possession." Neh. xi. 3. 21;

               Again. The Israelites often <i>hired</i> servants from
               the strangers. Deut. xxiv. 17.

            </p>
            <p>
               Since then it is certain that they gave wages to a part of their Canaanitish
               servants, thus recognizing their <em>right</em> to a reward for their
               labor, we infer that they did not rob the rest of their earnings.

               If God gave them a license to make the strangers work for them

               <em>right and just in itself</em>, they must have been great fools to
               have wasted their money by paying wages when they could have saved it, by
               making the strangers do all their work for nothing! Besides, by refusing to
               avail themselves of this "Divine license," they despised the blessing and
               cast contempt on the giver! But far be it from us to do the Israelites
               injustice; perhaps they seized all the Canaanites they could lay their
               hands on, and forced them to work without pay, but not being able to
               catch enough to do their work, were obliged to offer wages in order to
               eke out the supply!

            </p>
            <p>
               The parable of our Lord, contained in Mat. xviii. 23-34, not only derives
               its significance from the fact, that servants can both <em>own</em>
               and <em>owe</em> and <em>earn</em> property, over which they had the
               control, but would be made a medley of contradictions on any other
               supposition.&#8212;1. Their lord at a set time proceeded to "take account"
               and "reckon" with his servants; the phraseology itself showing that the
               relations between the parties, were those of debt and credit. 2. As the
               reckoning went on, one of his servants was found to <em>owe</em> him ten
               thousand talents. From the fact that the servant <em>owed</em> this to
               his master, we naturally infer, that he must have been at some time, and in
               some way, the responsible <em>owner</em> of that amount, or of its
               substantial equivalent. Not that he had had that amount put into his hands to
               invest, or disburse, in his master's name, merely as his
               <i>agent</i>, for in that case no claim of
               <i>debt</i> for value
               received would lie, but, that having sustained the responsibilities of legal
               <i>proprietorship</i>, he was under the liabilities
               resulting therefrom. 3. Not having on hand wherewith to pay, he says to his
               master "have patience with me <em>and I will pay thee all</em>." If the
               servant had been his master's <i>property</i>, his time
               and earnings belonged to the master as a matter of course, hence the promise
               to earn and pay over that amount, was virtually saying to his master, "I
               will take money out of your pocket with which to pay my debt to you," thus
               adding insult to injury. The promise of the servant to pay the debt on
               condition that the time for payment should be postponed, not only proceeds
               upon the fact that his

               time was his own, that he was constantly earning property or in circumstances
               that enabled him to earn it, and that he was the
               <i>proprietor</i> of his earnings, but that his master
               had <em>full knowledge</em> of that fact.&#8212;In a word, the supposition
               that the master was the <i>owner</i> of the servant,
               would annihilate all legal claim upon him for value received, and that
               the servant was the <i>property</i> of the master, would
               absolve him from all obligations of debt, or rather would always
               <em>forestall</em> such obligations&#8212;for the relations of owner and
               creditor in such case, would annihilate each other, as would those of
               <i>property</i> and <i>debtor</i>.
               The fact that the same servant was the creditor of one of his fellow servants,
               who owed him a considerable sum, and that at last he was imprisoned until he
               should pay all that was due to his master, are additional corroborations of
               the same point.

            </p>
            <p>
               IV. HEIRSHIP.&#8212;Servants frequently inherited their master's property;
               especially if he had no sons, or if they had dishonored the family.
               Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, Gen. xv. 23; Ziba, the servant of
               Mephibosheth; Jarha, the servant of Sheshan, who married his daughter,
               and thus became his heir, he having no sons, and the
               <i>husbandmen</i> who said of their master's son, "this
               is the HEIR, let us kill him, and the INHERITANCE WILL BE OURS," are
               illustrations; also Prov. xxx. 23, an <i>handmaid</i>
               (or <i>maid-servant</i>,) that is <em>heir</em> to her
               mistress; also Prov. xvii. 2&#8212;"A wise servant shall have rule over a son
               that causeth shame, and SHALL HAVE PART OF THE INHERITANCE AMONG THE
               BRETHREN." This passage gives servants precedence as heirs, even over the
               wives and daughters of their masters. Did masters hold by force, and
               plunder of earnings, a class of persons, from which, in frequent contingencies,
               they selected both heirs for their property, and husbands
               for their daughters?

            </p>
            <p>
               V. ALL WERE REQUIRED TO PRESENT OFFERINGS AND SACRIFICES.
               Deut. xvi. 16, 17; 2 Chron. xv. 9-11; Numb. ix. 13, 14. Beside this,
               "every man" from twenty years old and above, was required to pay
               a tax of half a shekel at the taking of the census; this is called "an
               offering unto the Lord to make an atonement for their souls." Ex.
               xxx. 12-16. See also Ex. xxxiv. 20. Servants must have had permanently
               the means of <em>acquiring</em> property to meet these expenditures.

            </p>
            <p>
               VI. SERVANTS WHO WENT OUT AT THE SEVENTH YEAR, WERE "FURNISHED
               LIBERALLY." Deut. xv. 10-14. "Thou shalt furnish him liberally
               out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy wine press, of
               that wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed thee, thou shalt give
               him."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN26"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN26"></a>
               If it be said that the servants from the Strangers did not receive a like
               bountiful supply, we answer, neither did the most honorable class of
               <em>Israelitish</em> servants, the free-holders; and for the same
               reason, <em>they did not go out in the seventh year,</em> but continued
               until the jubilee. If the fact that the Gentile servants did not receive such
               a <i>gratuity</i> proves that they were robbed of their
               <i>earnings</i>, it proves that the most valued
               class of <em>Hebrew</em> servants were robbed of theirs also; a
               conclusion too stubborn for even pro-slavery masticators, however
               unscrupulous.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN26"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN26">A</a>: The comment of Maimonides on this passage
               is as follows&#8212;"'Thou shalt furnish him liberally,' &amp;c. That is to
               say, <em>'Loading, ye shall load him,'</em> likewise
               every one of his family with as much as he can take with him&#8212;abundant
               benefits. And if it be avariciously asked, 'How much must I give him?' I
               say unto <em>you, not less than thirty shekels,</em> which is the
               valuation of a servant, as declared in Ex. xxi. 32."&#8212;Maimonides,

               VII. SERVANTS WERE BOUGHT. In other words, they received compensation
               in advance.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN27"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN27"></a> Having shown,
               under a previous head, that servants <em>sold themselves</em>, and of
               course received the compensation for themselves, except in cases where
               parents hired out the time of their children till they became of
               age,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN28"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN28"></a> a mere reference to the fact is all
               that is required for the purposes of this argument. As all the strangers
               in the land were required to pay an annual tribute to the government,
               the Israelites might often "buy" them as family servants, by stipulating
               with them to pay their annual tribute. This assumption of their obligations
               to the government might cover the whole of the servant's time of

               received their pay in advance, and if the Israelites were forbidden to
               surrender the fugitive to his master, it would operate practically as a
               bounty offered to all servants who would leave their master's
               service encouraging them to make contracts, get their pay in advance and
               then run away, thus cheating their masters out of their money as well as their
               own services.&#8212;We answer, the prohibition, Deut xxiii. 15. 16, "Thou
               shalt not deliver unto his master," &amp;c., sets the servant free from his
               <em>authority</em> and of course, from all those liabilities of injury,
               to which <i>as his servant</i>, he was subjected, but not
               from the obligation of legal contracts. If the servant had received pay in
               advance, and had not rendered an equivalent for this "value received," he
               was not absolved from his obligation to do so, but he was absolved from all
               obligations to pay his master in <em>that particular way</em>, that is,
               <em>by working for him as his servant</em>.

               VIII. THE RIGHT OF SERVANTS TO COMPENSATION IS RECOGNISED IN
               Ex. xxi. 27. "And if he smite out his man-servant's, or his maid-servant's
               tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake." This regulation
               is manifestly based upon the <em>right</em> of the servant to the
               <em>use</em> of

               himself and all this powers, faculties and personal conveniences, and
               consequently his just claim for remuneration, upon him, who should
               however <em>unintentionally</em>, deprive him of the use even of the
               least of them. If the servant had a right to his <em>tooth</em> and the
               use <em>of</em> it, upon the same principle, he had a right to the rest
               of his body and the use of it. If he had a right to the
               <em>fraction</em>, and if it was his to hold, to use, and to
               have pay for; he had a right to the <em>sum total</em>, and it was his to
               hold, to use, and to have pay for.

               IX. WE FIND MASTERS AT ONE TIME HAVING A LARGE NUMBER OF SERVANTS,
               AND AFTERWARDS NONE, WITH NO INTIMATION IN ANY CASE THAT
               THEY WERE SOLD. The wages of servants would enable them to set up
               in business for themselves. Jacob, after being Laban's servant for
               twenty-one years, became thus an independent herdsman, and had
               many servants. Gen. xxx. 43; xxxii. 16. But all these servants had left
               him before he went down into Egypt, having doubtless acquired enough
               to commence business for themselves. Gen. xlv. 10, 11; xlvi. 1-7,
               32. The case of Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, who had twenty
               servants, has been already mentioned.

            <p>
               X. GOD'S TESTIMONY TO THE CHARACTER OF ABRAHAM. Gen. xviii. 19.
               "For I know him that he will command his children and his household
               after him, and they shall keep THE WAY OF THE LORD TO DO JUSTICE
               AND JUDGMENT." God here testifies that Abraham taught his servants
               "the way of the Lord." What was the "way of the Lord" respecting
               the payment of wages where service was rendered? "Wo
               unto him that useth this neighbor's service WITHOUT WAGES!" Jer. xxii. 13.
               "Masters, give unto your servants that which is JUST AND EQUAL." Col. iv. 1.
               "Render unto all their DUES." Rom. xiii. 7. "The laborer is WORTHY of HIS
               HIRE." Luke x. 7. How did Abraham teach his servants to
               "<em>do justice</em>" to others? By doing injustice to <em>them</em>?
               Did he exhort them to "render to all their dues" by keeping back
               <em>their own</em>? Did he teach them that "the laborer was worthy
               of his hire" by robbing them of <em>theirs</em>? Did he beget in them a
               reverence for honesty by pilfering all their time and labor? Did he teach
               them "not to defraud" others "in any matter" by denying <em>them</em>
               "what was just and equal?" If each of Abraham's pupils under such a catechism
               did not become a very <em>Aristides</em> in justice, then illustrious
               examples, patriarchal dignity, and <em>practical</em> lessons, can make
               but slow headway against human perverseness!

            <p>
               XI. SPECIFIC PRECEPTS OF THE MOSAIC LAW ENFORCING GENERAL
               PRINCIPLES. Out of many, we select the following: (1.) "Thou
               shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn." Deut. xxv. 4.

               Here is a general principle applied to a familiar case. The ox representing
               all domestic animals. Isa. xxx. 24. A <em>particular</em> kind of service,
               <em>all</em> kinds; and a law requiring an abundant provision for the
               wants of an animal ministering to man in a <em>certain</em> way,&#8212;a
               general principle of treatment covering all times, modes, and
               instrumentalities
               of service. The object of the law was; not merely to enjoin tenderness
               towards brutes, but to inculcate the duty of rewarding those who
               serve us; and if such care be enjoined, by God, both for the ample
               sustenance and present enjoyment of <em>a brute</em>, what would be a meet
               return for the services of <em>man?</em>&#8212;MAN with his varied wants,
               exalted nature and immortal destiny! Paul says expressly, that this principle
               lies at the bottom of the statute. 1 Cor. ix. 9, 10, "For it is written
               in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that
               treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? Or saith he
               it altogether for OUR sakes? that he that ploweth should plow in HOPE,
               and that he that thresheth in hope should be PARTAKER OF HIS HOPE."
               In the context, Paul innumerates the four grand divisions of labor
               among the Jews in illustration of the principle that the laborer, whatever
               may be the service he performs, is entitled to a <em>reward</em>. The
               priests, Levites and all engaged in sacred things&#8212;the military, those
               who tended flocks and herds, and those who cultivated the soil. As
               the latter employment engaged the great body of the Israelites, the
               Apostle amplifies his illustration under that head by much detail&#8212;and
               enumerates the five great departments of agricultural labor among
               the Jews&#8212;vine-dressing, plowing, sowing, reaping and threshing, as
               the representatives of universal labor. In his epistle to Timothy. 1
               Tim. v. 18. Paul quotes again this precept of the Mosaic law, and
               connects with it the declaration of our Lord. Luke x. 7. "The laborer
               is worthy of his hire,"&#8212;as both inculcating the <em>same</em>
               doctrine, that he who labors, whatever the employment, or whoever the laborer,
               is entitled to a reward. The Apostle thus declares the principle of right
               respecting the performance of service for others, and the rule of duty
               towards those who perform it, to be the same under both dispensations.
               (2.) "If thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee,
               then thou shalt relieve him, YEA THOUGH HE BE A STRANGER or a SOJOURNER
               that he may live with thee. Take thou no usury of him, or
               increase, but fear thy God. Thou shalt not give him thy money upon
               usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase." Lev. xxv. 35-37.
               Now, we ask, by what process of pro-slavery legerdemain, this regulation
               can be made to harmonize with the doctrine of WORK WITHOUT
               PAY? Did God declare the poor stranger entitled to RELIEF, and in
	       <a name="E4r4_47"></a>

               the same breath, authorize them to "use his service without wages;"
               force him to work and ROB HIM OF HIS EARNINGS?

               IV.&#8212;WERE MASTERS THE PROPRIETORS OF SERVANTS AS LEGAL PROPERTY?

            </h3>
            <p>
               This topic has been unavoidably somewhat anticipated, in the foregoing
               discussion, but a variety of additional considerations remain to be
               noticed.

            </p>
            <p><a name="E4r4_noown_useprop"></a>
               I. SERVANTS WERE NOT SUBJECTED TO THE USES NOR LIABLE TO
               THE CONTINGENCIES OF PROPERTY. 1 <em>They were never taken in payment
                  for their masters' debts</em>. Children were sometimes taken (without
               legal authority) for the debts of a father. 2 Kings iv. 1; Job xxiv. 9;
               Isa. l. 1; Matt. xviii. 25. Creditors took from debtors property of
               all kinds, to satisfy their demands. Job xxiv. 3, cattle are taken; Prov.
               xxii. 27, household furniture; Lev. xxv. 25-28, the productions of
               the soil; Lev. xxv. 27-30, houses; Ex. xxii. 26, 27; Deut. xxiv.
               10-13; Matt. v. 40, clothing; but <i>servants</i> were
               taken in <em>no instance</em>.
               2. <em>Servants were never given as pledges</em>.
               <i>Property</i> of all sorts was pledged for value
               received; household furniture, clothing, cattle, money, signets, personal
               ornaments, &amp;c., but no servants. 3. <em>Servants were not put into the
                  hands of others, or consigned to their keeping</em>. The precept giving
               directions how to proceed in a case where property that has life is
               delivered to another "to keep," and "it die or be hurt or driven away,"
               enumerates oxen, asses, sheep or "any <em>beast</em>," but not
               "<i>servants</i>." Ex. xxii. 10. 4. <em>All lost property
                  was to be restored</em>. Oxen, asses, sheep, raiment, and "all lost
               things," are specified&#8212;servants <em>not</em>. Deut. xxii 1-3.
               Besides, the Israelites were forbidden to return the runaway servant.
               Deut. xxiii, 15. 5. <em>Servants were not sold</em>. When by flagrant
               misconduct, unfaithfulness or from whatever cause, they had justly
               forfeited their privilege of membership in an Israelitish family, they
               were not sold, but <em>expelled</em> from the household. Luke xvi. 2-4;
               2 Kings v. 20, 27; Gen. xxi. 14. 6 <em>The Israelites never received
                  servants as tribute</em>. At different times all the nations round about
               them were their tributaries and paid them annually large amounts. They
               received property of all kinds in payment of tribute. Gold, silver, brass,
               iron, precious stone, and vessels, armor, spices, raiment, harness, horses,
               mules, sheep, goats, &amp;c., are in various places enumerated, but
               <i>servants</i>, never. 7. <em>The Israelites never
                  gave away their servants as presents</em>. They made costly presents, of
               great variety. Lands, houses, all kinds

               of domestic animals, beds, merchandize, family utensils, precious metals,
               grain, honey, butter, cheese, fruits, oil, wine, raiment, armor, &amp;c., are
               among their recorded <em>gifts</em>. Giving presents to superiors and
               persons of rank, was a standing usage. 1 Sam. x. 27; xvi. 20; 2 Chron.
               xvii. 5. Abraham to Abimelech, Gen. xxi. 27; Jacob to the viceroy
               of Egypt, Gen. xliii. 11; Joseph to his brethren and father, Gen.
               xlv. 22, 23; Benhadad to Elisha, 2 Kings viii. 8, 9; Ahaz to Tiglath
               Pilezer, 2 Kings vi. 8; Solomon to the Queen of Sheba, 1 Kings x. 13;
               Jeroboam to Ahijah, 1 Kings xiv. 3; Asa to Benhadad, 1 Kings xv. 18,
               19. Abigail the wife of Nabal to David, 1 Sam. xxv. 18. David to the
               elders of Judah, 1 Sam. xxx. 26. Jehoshaphat to his sons, 2. Chron.
               xxi. 3. The Israelites to David, 1. Chron. xii. 39, 40. Shobi Machir
               and Barzillai to David, 2 Sam. xvii. 28, 29. But no servants were given
               as presents, though it was a prevailing fashion in the surrounding nations.
               Gen. xii. 16, xx. 14. In the last passage we are told that Abimelech
               king of the Philistines "took sheep and oxen and men servants
               and women servants and gave them unto Abraham." Not long after
               this Abraham made Abimelech a present, the same kind with that which
               he had received from him except that he gave him <em>no servants</em>.
               "And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto Abimelech." Gen.
               xxi. 27. It may be objected that Laban "GAVE" handmaids to his
               daughters, Jacob's wives. Without enlarging on the nature of the polygamy
               then prevalent, suffice it to say that the handmaids of wives were
               regarded as wives, though of inferior dignity and authority. That
               Jacob so regarded his handmaids, is proved by his curse upon Reuben,
               Gen. xlix. 4, and 1 Chron. v. 1; also by the equality of their children
               with those of Rachel and Leah. But had it been otherwise&#8212;had Laban
               given them as <i>articles of property</i>, then, indeed,
               the example of this "good old slaveholder and patriarch," Saint Laban, would
               have been a forecloser to all argument. Ah! we remember his jealousy for
               <em>religion</em>&#8212;his holy indignation when he found that his
               "GODS" were stolen! How he mustered his clan, and plunged over the desert in
               hot pursuit seven days by forced marches; how he ransacked a whole
               caravan, sifting the contents of every tent, little heeding such small matters
               as domestic privacy, or female seclusion, for lo! the zeal of his
               "IMAGES" had eaten him up! No wonder that slavery, in its Bible-navigation,
               drifting dismantled before the free gusts, should scud under
               the lee of such a pious worthy to haul up and refit; invoking his protection,
               and the benediction, of his "GODS!" <a name="E4r4_noown_distprop"></a>Again,
               it may be objected
               that, servants were enumerated in inventories of property. If that
               proves <i>servants</i> property, it proves
               <em>wives</em> property. "Thou shall not

               covet thy neighbor's house, thou shall not covet thy neighbor's WIFE,
               nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor
               any thing that is thy neighbor's." Ex. xx. 17. In inventories of
               mere property, if servants are included, it is in such a way as to show
               that they are not regarded as property. Eccl. ii. 7, 8. But when the
               design is to show, not merely the wealth, but the <em>greatness</em> and
               <em>power</em> of any one, servants are spoken of, as well as property.
               In a word, if <em>riches</em> alone are spoken of, no mention is made of
               servants; if <em>greatness</em>, servants and property. Gen. xiii. 2,
               5. "And Abraham was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold." Yet we are
               told, in the verse preceding, that he came up out of Egypt "with
               <em>all</em> that he had." "And Lot also had flocks, and herds, and
               tents." In the seventh verse servants are mentioned, "And there was a strife
               between the HERDMEN of Abraham's cattle and the HERDMEN of Lot's cattle." It
               is said of Isaac. "And the man waxed <em>great</em>, and went forward,
               and grew until he became <em>very great</em>. For he had possession of
               flocks, and possession of herds, and <em>great store of servants</em>."
               In immediate connection with this we find Abimelech the king of the
               Philistines saying to him. "Thou art much <em>mightier</em> than we."
               Shortly after this avowal, Isaac is waited upon by a deputation consisting of
               Abimelech, Phicol the chief captain of his army, and Ahuzzath, who says to
               him "Let there be now an oath betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant
               with thee, that thou wilt <em>do us no hurt</em>." Gen. xxvi. 13, 14, 16,
               26, 28, 29.&#8212;A plain concession of the <em>power</em> which Isaac
               had both for aggression and defence in his "great store of
               <i>servants</i>;" that is, of willing
               and affectionate
               adherents to him as a just and benevolent prince. When Hamor and Shechem
               speak to the Hivites of the <em>riches</em> of Abraham
               and his sons, they say, "Shall not their <em>cattle</em> and their
               <em>substance</em> and <em>every beast of theirs</em> be ours?"
               Gen. xxxiv. 23. See also Josh. xxii. 8;
               Gen. xxxiv. 23; Job. xlii. 12; 2 Chron. xxi. 3; xxxii. 27-29; Job.
               i. 3-5; Deut. viii. 12-17; Gen. xxiv. 35; xxvi. 13; xxx. 43. Jacob's
               wives say to him, "All the <em>riches</em> which God has taken from our
               father that is ours and our children's." Then follows an inventory of
               property&#8212;"All his cattle," "all his goods," "the cattle of his getting."
               His numerous servants are not included with his property. Comp.
               Gen. xxx. 43, with Gen. xxxi. 16-18. When Jacob sent messengers
               to Esau, wishing to impress him with an idea of his state
               and sway, he bade them tell him not only of his RICHES, but of his
               GREATNESS; that he had "oxen, and asses, and flocks, and men-servants,
               and maid-servants." Gen. xxxii. 4, 5. Yet in the present which he sent,
               there were no servants; though he manifestly selected the
               <em>most valuable</em> kinds of property. Gen. xxxii. 14, 15; see also
               Gen. xxxvi. 6, 7; xxxiv. 23. As flocks and herds were the staples of
               wealth, a large number of servants presupposed large possessions of
               cattle, which would require many herdsmen. When Jacob and his
               sons went down into Egypt it is repeatedly asserted that they took
               <em>all that they had</em>. "Their cattle and their goods which they
               had gotten in the land of Canaan," "Their flocks and their herds" are
               mentioned, but no <i>servants</i>. And as we have besides
               a full catalogue of the <em>household</em>, we know that he took with him
               no servants. That Jacob <em>had</em> many servants before his migration
               into Egypt, we learn from Gen, xxx. 43; xxxii. 5, 16, 19. That he was not
               the <i>proprietor</i> of these servants as his property
               is a probable inference from the fact that he did not take them with him,
               since we are expressly told that he did take all his <em>property</em>.
               Gen. xlv. 10; xlvi. 1, 32; xlvii. 1. When servants are spoken of in
               connection with <em>mere property</em>, the terms used to
               express the latter do not include the former. The Hebrew word
               <i>mikn&#275;</i>, is an illustration.
               It is derived from <i>k&#257;n&#257;</i>, to
               procure, to buy, and its meaning is, a <i>possession,
                  wealth, riches</i>. It occurs more than forty times in the Old Testament,
               and is applied always to <em>mere property</em>, generally to domestic
               animals, but never to servants. In some instances, servants are mentioned in
               distinction from the <i>mikn&#275;</i>.
               <a name="E4r4_noown_gen_12_5"></a>"And Abraham took Sarah his wife, and Lot
               his brother's son, and
               all their SUBSTANCE that they had gathered; and the souls that they
               had gotten in Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of
               Canaan." Gen. xii. 5. Many will have it, that these
               <i>souls</i> were a part of Abraham's
               <em>substance</em> (notwithstanding the pains here taken to separate them
               from it)&#8212;that they were slaves taken with him in his migration as a
               part of his family effects. Who but slaveholders, either actually or in heart,
               would torture into the principle and practice of slavery, such a harmless
               phrase as "<i>the souls that they had gotten?</i>"
               Until the African slave trade breathed its haze into the eyes of the
               church and smote her with palsy and decay, commentators saw no slavery
               in, "The souls that they had gotten." In the Targum of
               Onkelos<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN29"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN29"></a>
               it is rendered, "The souls whom they had brought to obey the law
               in Haran." In the Targum of Jonathan, "The souls whom they had
               made proselytes in Haran." In the Targum of Jerusalem, "The souls
               proselyted in Haran." Jarchi, the prince of Jewish commentators, "The
               souls whom they had brought under the Divine wings." Jerome, one of the
               most learned of the Christian fathers, "The persons whom they had
               proselyted." The Persian version, the Vulgate, the Syriac, the Arabic,
               and the Samaritan all render it, "All the wealth which they had gathered,
               and the souls which they had made in Haran." Menochius, a commentator
               who wrote before our present translation of the Bible, renders
               it, "Quas de idolatraria converterant." "Those whom they had
               converted from idolatry." Paulus Fagius,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN30"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN30"></a> "Quas instituerant
               in religione." "Those whom they had established in religion." Luke
               Francke, a German commentator who lived two centuries ago, "Quas
               legi subjicerant."&#8212;"Those whom they had brought to obey the law."
               The same distinction is made between <em>persons</em> and property, in
               the enumeration of Esau's household and the inventory of his effects. "And
               Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters, and all the
               <em>persons</em> of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and
               all his <em>substance</em> which he had got in the land of Canaan, and
               went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. For their
               <em>riches</em> were more than that they might dwell together; and the
               land could not bear them because of their <em>cattle</em>."
               Gen. xxxvi. 6, 7.

               parts of the Old Testament. The Targum of Onkelos is, for the most part, a
               very accurate and faithful translation of the original, and was probably made
               at about the commencement of the Christian era. The Targum of Jonathan Ben
               Uzziel, bears about the same date. The Targum of Jerusalem was probably
               about five hundred years later. The Israelites, during their captivity in
               Babylon, lost, as a body, their own language. These translations into the
               Chaldee, the language which they acquired in Babylon, were thus called for
               by the necessity of the case.

               II. THE CONDITION AND SOCIAL ESTIMATION OF SERVANTS MAKE THE
               DOCTRINE THAT THEY WERE COMMODITIES, AN ABSURDITY. As the head
               of a Jewish family possessed the same power over his wife, children,
               and grandchildren (if they were in his family) as over his servants, if
               the latter were articles of property, the former were equally such. If
               there were nothing else in the Mosaic Institutes or history establishing
               the social equality of the servants with their masters and their master's
               wives and children, those precepts which required that they should be
               guests at all the public feasts, and equal participants in the family and
               social rejoicings, would be quite sufficient to settle the question. Deut.
               xii. 12, 18; xvi. 10, 11, 13, 14. Ex. xii. 43, 44. St. Paul's testimony
               in Gal. iv. 1, shows the condition of servants: "Now I say unto
               you, that the heir, so long as he is a child, DIFFERETH NOTHING FROM A

               SERVANT, though he be lord of all." That the interests of Abraham's
               servants were identified with those of their master's family, and that
               the utmost confidence was reposed in them, is shown in their being
               armed. Gen. xiv. 14, 15. When Abraham's servant went to Padanaram,
               the young Princess Rebecca did not disdain to say to him.
               "Drink, MY LORD," as "she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her
               hand, and gave him drink." Laban, the brother of Rebecca, "ungirded
               his camels, and brought him water to wash his feet, and the men's
               feet that were with him!" In the arrangements of Jacob's household
               on his journey from Padanaram to Canaan, we find his two maid servants
               treated in the same manner and provided with the same accommodations
               as Rachel and Leah. Each of them had a separate tent
               appropriated to her use. Gen. xxxi. 33. The social equality of servants
               with their masters and other members of their master's families,
               is an obvious deduction from Ex. xxi. 7, 10, from which we learn that
               the sale of a young Jewish female as a servant, was also <em>betrothed as a
                  wife</em>, either to her master, or to one of his sons. In 1 Sam. ix. is an
               account of a festival in the city of Zuph, at which Samuel presided.
               None but those bidden, sat down at the feast, and only "about thirty
               persons" were invited. Quite a select party!&#8212;the elite of the city.
               Saul and his servant had just arrived at Zuph, and <em>both</em> of them,
               at Samuel's solicitation, accompany him as invited guests. "And Samuel
               took Saul and his SERVANT, and brought THEM into the PARLOR (!) and
               made THEM sit in the CHIEFEST SEATS among those that were bidden."
               A <i>servant</i> invited by the chief judge, ruler, and
               prophet in Israel, to dine publicly with a select party, in company with his
               master, who was at the same time anointed King of Israel! and this servant
               introduced by Samuel into the PARLOR, and assigned, with his master, to the
               <em>chiefest seat</em> at the table! This was "<em>one</em> of the
               servants" of Kish, Saul's father; not the steward or the chief of
               them&#8212;not at all a <em>picked</em> man, but "<em>one</em> of
               the servants;" <em>any</em> one that could be most easily spared, as
               no endowments specially rare would be likely to find scope in looking
               after asses. David seems to have been for a time in all respects a servant
               in Saul's family. He "<em>stood before him</em>." "And Saul sent to
               Jesse, saying, let David, I pray thee, <em>stand before me</em>." He was
               Saul's personal servant, went on his errands, played on the harp for his
               amusement, bore his armor for him, and when he wished to visit his
               parents, asked permission of Jonathan, Saul's son. Saul also calls him
               "my servant." 1 Sam. xvi. 21-23; xviii. 5; xx. 5, 6; xxii. 8.
               Yet David sat with the king at meat, married his daughter, and lived
               on terms of the closest intimacy with the heir apparent of the throne.

               Abimelech, who was first elected king of Shechem, and afterwards
               reigned over all Israel, <em>was the son of a</em> MAID-SERVANT. His
               mother's family seems to have been of much note in the city of Shechem, where
               her brothers manifestly held great sway. Judg. ix. 1-6, 18. Jarha,
               an Egyptian, the servant of Sheshan, married his daughter. Tobiah,
               "the servant" and an Ammonite married the daughter of Shecaniah
               one of the chief men among the Jews in Jerusalem and was the intimate
               associate of Sanballat the governor of the Samaritans. We find Elah,
               the King of Israel, at a festive entertainment, in the house of Arza, his
               steward, or head servant, with whom he seems to have been on terms
               of familiarity. 1 Kings xvi. 8, 9. See also the intercourse between
               Gideon and his servants. Judg. vi. 27, and vii. 10, 11. The Levite
               of Mount Ephraim and his servant. Judg. xx. 3, 9, 11, 13, 19,
               21, 22. King Saul and his servant Doeg, one of his herdmen. 1
               Sam. xx. 1, 7; xxii. 9, 18, 22. King David and Ziba, the servant
               of Mephibosheth. 2 Sam. xvi. 1-4. Jonathan and his servant. 1
               Sam. xiv. 1-14. Elisha and his servant, Gehazi. 2 Kings iv. v. vi.
               Also between Joram king of Israel and the servant of Elisha. 2 Kings
               viii. 4, 5, and between Naaman "the Captain of the host of the king of
               Syria" and the same person. 2 Kings v. 21-23. The fact stated under
               a previous head that servants were always invited guests at public and
               social festivals, is in perfect keeping with the foregoing exemplifications
               of the prevalent estimation in which servants were held by the Israelites.

            </p>
            <p>
               Probably no one of the Old Testament patriarchs had more servants
               than Job; "This man was the greatest man of all the men of
               the east." Job, i. 3. We are not left in the dark as to the condition
               of his servants. After asserting his integrity, his strict justice, honesty,
               and equity, in his dealings with his fellow men, and declaring "I delivered
               the poor," "I was eyes to the blind and feet was I to the lame,"
               "I was a father to the poor, and the cause which I knew not I searched
               out," * * * he says "If I did despise the cause of my man-servant
               or my maid-servant when they CONTENDED with me * * * then let mine
               arm fall from the shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the
               bone." Job. xxix. 12, 15, 16; xxxi. 13, 22. The language employed
               in this passage is the phraseology applied in judicial proceedings
               to those who implead one another, and whether it be understood literally
               or figuratively, shows that whatever difference existed between
               Job and his servants in other respects, so far as <em>rights</em> are
               concerned, they were on equal ground with him, and that in the matter of daily
               intercourse, there was not the least restraint on their
               <em>free speech</em> in calling in question all his transactions with
               them, and that the relations

               and claims of both parties were adjudicated on the principles of equity
               and reciprocal right. "If I <em>despised</em> the cause of my
               man-servant," &amp;c. In other words, if I treated it lightly, as though
               servants were not men, had not rights, and had not a claim for just dues and
               just estimation as human beings. "When they <em>contended</em> with me,"
               that is, when they plead their rights, claimed what was due to them, or
               questioned the justice of any of my dealings with them.

            </p>
            <p>
               In the context Job virtually affirms as the ground of his just and
               equitable treatment of his servants, that they had the same rights as he
               had, and were, as human beings, entitled to equal consideration with himself.
               By what language could he more forcibly utter his conviction of
               the oneness of their common origin and of the identity of their common
               nature, necessities, attribute and rights? As soon as he has said, "If
               I did despise the cause of my man-servant," &amp;c., he follows it up with
               "What then shall I do when God raiseth up? and when he visiteth,
               what shall I answer him? Did not he that made me in the womb,
               make <em>him</em>? and did not one fashion us in the womb." In the next
               verse Job glories in the fact that he has not "<em>withheld from the poor
                  their desire</em>." Is it the "desire" of the poor to be
               <em>compelled</em> by the rich to work for them, and without
               <em>pay</em>?

               III. THE CASE OF THE GIBEONITES. The condition of the inhabitants
               of Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim, under the Hebrew
               commonwealth, is quoted in triumph by the advocates of slavery; and
               truly they are right welcome to all the crumbs that can be gleaned
               from it. Milton's devils made desperate snatches at fruit that turned
               to ashes on their lips. The spirit of slavery raves under tormenting
               gnawings, and casts about in blind phrenzy for something to ease, or
               even to mock them. But for this, it would never have clutched at the
               Gibeonites, for even the incantations of the demon cauldron could not
               extract from their case enough to tantalize starvation's self. But to the
               question. What was the condition of the Gibeonites under the Israelites?
               1. <em>It was voluntary</em>. Their own proposition to Joshua was to
               become servants. Josh. ix. 8, 11. It was accepted, but the kind of
               service which they should perform, was not specified until their gross
               imposition came to light; they were then assigned to menial offices in
               the Tabernacle. 2. <em>They were not domestic servants in the families of
                  the Israelites</em>. They still resided in their own cities, cultivated
               their own fields, tended their flocks and herds, and exercised the functions
               of a <em>distinct</em>, though not independent community. They were
               subject to the Jewish nation as <i>tributaries</i>. So
               far from being distributed among the Israelites and their internal
               organization as a distinct people abolished,

               they remained a separate, and, in some respects, an independent
               community for many centuries. When attacked by the Amorites, they
               applied to the Israelites as confederates for aid&#8212;it was rendered, their
               enemies routed, and themselves left unmolested in their cities. Josh. x.
               6-18. Long afterwards, Saul slew some of them, and God sent upon
               Israel a three years' famine for it. David inquired of the Gibeonites,
               "What shall I do for you, and wherewith shall I make the atonement?"
               At their demand, he delivered up to them seven of Saul's descendants.
               2 Sam. xxi. 1-9. The whole transaction was a formal recognition
               of the Gibeonites as a distinct people. There is no intimation that
               they served either families or individuals of the Israelites, but only the
               "house of God," or the Tabernacle. This was established first at
               Gilgal, a days' journey from their cities; and then at Shiloh, nearly
               two days' journey from them; where it continued about 350 years.
               During this period the Gibeonites inhabited their ancient cities and
               territory. Only a few, comparatively, could have been absent at any
               one time in attendance on the Tabernacle. Wherever allusion is made
               to them in the history, the main body are spoken of as <em>at home</em>.
               It is preposterous to suppose that all the inhabitants of these four cities
               could find employment at the Tabernacle. One of them "was a great city,
               as one of the royal cities;" so large, that a confederacy of five kings,
               apparently the most powerful in the land, was deemed necessary for
               its destruction. It is probable that the men were divided into classes,
               ministering in rotation&#8212;each class a few days or weeks at a time. As
               the priests whose assistants they were, served by courses in rotation a
               week at a time; it is not improbable that their periods of service were
               so arranged as to correspond. This service was their
               <i>national tribute</i> to the Israelites, for the
               privilege of residence and protection under their government. No service
               seems to have been required of the <em>females</em>. As these Gibeonites
               were Canaanites, and as they had greatly exasperated the Israelites by
               impudent imposition and lying, we might assuredly expect that they would
               reduce <em>them</em> to the condition of chattels, if there was
               <em>any</em> case in which God permitted them to do so.

               IV. EGYPTIAN BONDAGE ANALYZED. Throughout the Mosaic system,
               God warns the Israelites against holding their servants in such a condition
               as they were held in by the Egyptians. How often are they
               pointed back to the grindings of their prison-house! What motives to
               the exercise of justice and kindness towards their servants, are held out
               to their fears in threatened judgments; to their hopes in promised
               good; and to all within them that could feel, by those oft repeated
               words of tenderness and terror! "For ye were bondmen in the land

               of Egypt"&#8212;waking anew the memory of tears and anguish, and of the
               wrath that avenged them. But what was the bondage of the Israelites
               in Egypt? Of what rights were they plundered and what did they retain?

            </p>
            <p>
               1. <em>They were not dispersed among the families of
                  Egypt,[A] but formed a
                  separate community</em>. Gen. xlvi. 34. Ex. viii. 22, 24; ix. 26; x. 23;
               xi. 7; iv. 29; ii. 9; xvi. 22; xvii. 5; vi. 14. 2. <em>They had the
                  exclusive possession of the land of Goshen,[B]"the best part of the land" of
                  Egypt</em>. Gen. xlv. 18; xlvii. 6, 11, 27; Ex. viii. 22; ix. 26; xii. 4.
               Goshen must have been at a considerable distance from those parts of
               Egypt inhabited by the Egyptians; so far at least as to prevent their
               contact with the Israelites, since the reason assigned for locating them in
               Goshen was, that shepherds were "an abomination to the Egyptians;"
               besides, their employments would naturally lead them out of the settled
               parts of Egypt to find a free range of pasturage for their immense flocks
               and herds. 3. <em>They lived in permanent dwellings</em>. These were
               <em>houses</em>, not <em>tents</em>. In Ex. xii. 7, 22, the two
               side <i>posts</i>, and the upper door
               <i>posts</i>, and the lintel of the houses are mentioned.
               Each family seems to have occupied a house <em>by itself</em>.
               Acts vii. 20. Ex. xii. 4&#8212;and judging from the regulation about the
               eating of the Passover, they could hardly have been small ones, Ex. xii. 4;
               probably contained separate apartments, as the entertainment of sojourners
               seems to have been a common usage. Ex. iii. 23; and also places for
               concealment. Ex. ii. 2, 3; Acts vii. 20. They appear to have been
               well apparelled. Ex. xii. 11. 4. <em>They owned "flocks and
                  herds," and "very much cattle</em>." Ex. xii. 4, 6, 32, 37, 38. From the
               fact that "<em>every man</em>" was commanded to kill either a lamb or a
               kid, one year old, for the Passover, before the people left Egypt, we infer
               that even the poorest of the Israelites owned a flock either of sheep or
               goats. Further, the immense multitude of their flocks and herds may be judged
               of from the expostulation of Moses with Jehovah. Num. xii. 21, 22.

               "The people among whom I am are six hundred thousand footmen, and
               thou hast said I will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month;
               shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to <em>suffice</em>
               them." As these six hundred thousand were only the <em>men</em> "from
               twenty years old and upward, that were able to go forth to war,"
               Ex. i. 45, 46; the whole number of the Israelites could not have been less
               than three millions and a half. Flocks and herds to "suffice" all these for
               food, might surely be called "very much cattle." 5. <em>They had their own
                  form of government</em>, and preserved their tribe and family divisions,
               and their internal organization throughout, though still a province of Egypt,
               and <i>tributary</i> to it. Ex. ii. 1; xii. 19, 21;
               vi. 14, 25; v. 19; iii. 16, 18. 6. <em>They had in a considerable measure,
                  the disposal of their own time.</em> Ex. iii. 16, 18; xii. 6; ii. 9; and
               iv. 27, 29-31. <em>They seem to have practised the fine arts</em>.
               Ex. xxxii. 4; xxxv. 22, 35. 7. <em>They were all armed</em>.
               Ex. xxxii. 27. 8. <em>They held their possessions independently, and the
                  Egyptians seem to have regarded them as inviolable</em>. No intimation is
               given that the Egyptians dispossessed them of their habitations, or took
               away their flocks, or herds, or crops, or implements of agriculture, or
               any article of property. 9. <em>All the females seem to have known
                  something of domestic refinements</em>. They were familiar with instruments
               of music, and skilled in the working of fine fabrics.
               Ex. xv. 20; xxxv. 25, 26; and both males and females were
               able to read and write. Deut. xi. 18-20; xvii. 19; xxvii. 3.
               10. <em>Service seems to have been exacted from none but adult
                  males</em>. Nothing is said from which the bond service of females could be
               inferred; the hiding of Moses three months by his mother, and the
               payment of wages to her by Pharaoh's daughter, go against such a
               supposition. Ex. ii. 29. 11. <em>Their food was abundant and of great
                  variety</em>. So far from being fed upon a fixed allowance of a single
               article, and hastily prepared, "they sat by the flesh-pots," and "did eat
               bread to the full." Ex. xvi. 3; and their bread was prepared with
               leaven. Ex. xii. 15, 39. They ate "the fish freely, the cucumbers,
               and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic." Num.
               xi. 4, 5; xx. 5. Probably but a small portion of the people were in
               the service of the Egyptians at any one time. The extent and variety
               of their own possessions, together with such a cultivation of their
               crops as would provide them with bread, and such care of their immense
               flocks and herds, as would secure their profitable increase, must
               have kept at home the main body of the nation. During the plague of
               darkness, God informs us that "ALL the children of Israel had light in
               their dwellings." We infer that they were <em>there</em> to enjoy it.
               See also

               Ex. ix. 26. It seems improbable that the making of brick, the only
               service named during the latter part of their sojourn in Egypt, could
               have furnished permanent employment for the bulk of the nation. See
               also Ex. iv. 29-31. Besides, when Eastern nations employed tributaries,
               it was as now, in the use of the levy, requiring them to furnish
               a given quota, drafted off periodically, so that comparatively but a
               small portion of the nation would be absent <em>at any one time</em>. The
               adult males of the Israelites were probably divided into companies, which
               relieved each other at stated intervals of weeks or months. It might
               have been during one of these periodical furloughs from service that
               Aaron performed the journey to Horeb. Ex. iv. 27. At the least
               calculation this journey must have consumed <em>eight weeks</em>. Probably
               one-fifth part of the proceeds of their labor was required of the Israelites
               in common with the Egyptians. Gen. xlvii. 24, 26. Instead of
               taking it from their <em>crops</em>, (Goshen being better for
               <em>pasturage</em>) they exacted it of them in brick making; and labor
               might have been exacted only from the <em>poorer</em> Israelites, the
               wealthy being able to pay their tribute in money. The fact that all the
               elders of Israel seem to have controlled their own time,
               (See Ex. iv. 29; iii. 16; v. 20,) favors the supposition. Ex. iv. 27, 31.
               <a name="E4r4_noown_Amer"></a>Contrast this bondage of Egypt with American
               slavery. Have our slaves "flocks and herds even very
               much cattle?" Do they live in commodious houses of their own,
               "sit by the flesh-pots," "eat fish freely," and "eat bread to the full"?
               Do they live in a separate community, in their distinct tribes, under
               their own rulers, in the exclusive occupation of an extensive tract of
               country for the culture of their crops, and for rearing immense herds of
               their own cattle&#8212;and all these held inviolable by their masters? Are
               our female slaves free from exactions of labor and liabilities of outrage?
               or when employed, are they paid wages, as was the Israelitish
               woman by the king's daughter? Have they the disposal of their own
               time, and the means for cultivating social refinements, for practising
               the fine arts, and for personal improvement? THE ISRAELITES UNDER
               THE BONDAGE OF EGYPT, ENJOYED ALL THESE RIGHTS AND
               PRIVILEGES. True, "all the service wherein they made them serve
               was with rigor." But what was this when compared with the incessant
               toil of American slaves; the robbery of all their time and earnings,
               and even the "power to own any thing, or acquire any thing?"

               of lust, the lacerations and baptisms of blood, sanctioned by law, and
               patronized by public sentiment. What was the bondage of Egypt

               when compared with this? And yet for her oppression of the poor,
               God smote her with plagues, and trampled her as the mire, till she
               passed away in his wrath, and the place that knew her in her pride,
               knew her no more. Ah! "I have seen the afflictions of my people,
               and I have heard their groanings, and am come down to deliver them."
               HE DID COME, and Egypt sank a ruinous heap, and her blood closed
               over her. If such was God's retribution for the oppression of
               heathen Egypt, of how much sorer punishment shall a Christian people
               be thought worthy, who cloak with religion a system, in comparison
               with which the bondage of Egypt dwindles to nothing? Let
	       <a name="E4r4_64"></a>

               those believe who can, that God commissioned his people to rob
               others of <em>all</em> their rights, while he denounced against them
               wrath to the uttermost, if they practised the <em>far lighter</em>
               oppression of Egypt&#8212;which
               robbed its victims of only the least and cheapest of their
               rights, and left the females unplundered even of these. What! Is God
               divided against himself? When He had just turned Egypt into a
               funeral pile; while his curse yet blazed upon her unburied dead, and
               his bolts still hissed amidst her slaughter, and the smoke of her torment
               went upwards because she had "ROBBED THE POOR," did He
               license the VICTIMS of robbery to rob the poor of ALL? As
               <em>Lawgiver</em>, did he <em>create</em> a system tenfold more
               grinding than that for which he had just hurled Pharaoh headlong, and
               overwhelmed his princes and his hosts, till "hell was moved to meet them at
               their coming?"

               what will <em>barely keep them alive</em>, is all that a cruel avarice
               will allow them. Hence, in some instances, their allowance has been reduced
               to a <em>single pint of corn each</em>, during the day and night. And
               some have no better allowance than a small portion of cotton seed; while
               perhaps they are not permitted to taste meat so much as once in the course

               Asa A. Stone, a theological student, residing at Natchez, Mississippi, wrote

               "On almost every plantation, the hands suffer more or less from hunger at
               some seasons of almost every year. There is always a <em>good deal of

               In the debate on the Missouri question in the U.S. Congress, 1819-20, the
               admission of Missouri to the Union, as a slave state, was urged, among other
               grounds as a measure of humanity to the slaves of the south. Mr. Smyth, a
               member of Congress, from Virginia, and a large slaveholder, said, "The plan
               of our opponents seems to be to confine the slave population to the southern
               states, to the countries where sugar, cotton, and tobacco are cultivated.
               But, sir, by confining the slaves to a part of the country where crops are
               raised for exportation, and the bread and meat are purchased,
               <em>you doom them to scarcity and hunger</em>. Is it not
               obvious that the way to render their situation more comfortable is to allow
               them to be taken where there is not the same motive to force the slave to
               INCESSANT TOIL that there is in the country where cotton, sugar, and tobacco
               are raised for exportation. It is proposed to hem in the blacks
               <em>where they are</em> HARD WORKED and ILL FED, that they may be rendered
               unproductive and the race be prevented from increasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed
               measure would be EXTREME CRUELTY to the blacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;You would&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;
               doom them to SCARCITY and HARD LABOR."&#8212;[Speech of Mr. Smyth, of Va.,

               them warm. Often they are driven through frost and snow without either
               stocking or shoe, until the path they tread is died with their blood. And
               when they return to their miserable huts at night, they find not there the
               means of comfortable rest; but <em>on the cold ground they must lie without

               twenty-four, in summer, and fourteen in the winter&#8212;which would be in

               sunset!&#8212;See 2 Brevard's Digest, 243. The preamble of this law
               commences thus: "Whereas, <em>many</em> owners of slaves

               work <em>both night and day</em>. Abridged of their sleep, they scarce
               retire to rest during the whole period." See page 81. On the 87th page of
               the same work, the writer says, <em>"Both in summer and winter</em> the
               slaves must be <em>in the field</em> by the <em>first dawn of

               were hard to tell whether absurdity, fatuity, ignorance, or blasphemy,

               predominates, in the compound; each strives so lustily for the mastery,
               it may be set down a drawn battle. How often has it been bruited
               that the color of the negro is the <i>Cain-mark</i>,
               propagated downward. Cain's posterity started an opposition to the ark,
               forsooth, and rode out the flood with flying streamers! How could miracle be
               more worthily employed, or better vindicate the ways of God to man than by
               pointing such an argument, and filling out for slaveholders a Divine
               title-deed!

               Presbytery of Harmony, South Carolina, at their meeting in Wainsborough,
               S.C., Oct. 28, 1836, appointed a special committee to report on slavery.
               The following resolution is a part of the report adopted by the Presbytery.

            </p>
            <p>
               "Resolved, That slavery has existed from the days of those GOOD OLD
               SLAVEHOLDERS AND PATRIARCHS, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who are now in the
               kingdom of Heaven."

            </p>
            <p>
               Abraham receives abundant honor at the hands of slave-holding divines.
               Not because he was the "father of the faithful," forsook home and country for
               the truth's sake, was the most eminent preacher and practiser of righteousness
               in his day; nay, verily, for all this he gets faint praise; but then he had
               "SERVANTS BOUGHT WITH MONEY!!!" This is the finishing touch of his character,
               and its effect on slaveholders is electrical. Prose fledges into poetry, cold
               compliments warm into praise, eulogy rarifies into panegyric and goes off in
               rhapsody. In their ecstasies over Abraham, Isaac's paramount claims to their
               homage are lamentably lost sight of. It is quite unaccountable, that in their
               manifold oglings over Abraham's "servants bought with money," no slaveholder
               is ever caught casting loving side-glances at Gen. xxvii. 29, 37, where
               Isaac, addressing Jacob, says, "Be <em>lord</em> over thy brethren and
               let thy mother's sons <em>bow down</em> to thee." And afterwards,
               addressing Esau, he says, speaking of the birth-right immunities confirmed to
               Jacob, "Behold I have made him thy <em>Lord</em> and all his brethren
               have I GIVEN TO HIM FOR SERVANTS!"

            </p>
            <p>
               Here is a charter for slaveholding, under the sign manual of that "good old
               slaveholder and patriarch, Isaac." Yea, more&#8212;a "Divine Warrant" for a
               father holding his <em>children</em> as slaves and bequeathing them as
               property to his heirs! Better still, it proves that the favorite practice
               amongst our slaveholders of bequeathing their <em>colored</em> children
               to those of a different hue, was a "Divine institution," for Isaac
               "<em>gave</em>" Esau, who was "<em>red</em> all over," to Jacob,
               "<em>as a servant</em>." Now gentlemen, "honor to whom honor." Let Isaac
               no longer be stinted of the glory that is his due as the great prototype of
               that "peculiar domestic institution," of which you are eminent patrons, that
               nice discrimination, by which a father, in his will, makes part of his
               children <i>property</i>, and the rest, their
               <i>proprietors</i>, whenever the propriety of such a
               disposition is indicated, as in the case of Jacob and Esau, by the decisive
               tokens of COLOR and HAIR, (for, to show that Esau was Jacob's
               <em>rightful</em> property after he was "given to him" by Isaac "for a
               servant," the difference in <em>hair</em> as well as color,
               is expressly stated by inspiration!)

            </p>
            <p>
               One prominent feature of patriarchal example has been quite overlooked by
               slaveholders. We mean the special care of Isaac to inform Jacob that those
               "given to him as servants" were "HIS BRETHREN," (twice repeated.) The deep
               veneration of slaveholders for every thing patriarchal, clears them from all
               suspicion of <em>designedly</em> neglecting this authoritative precedent,
               and their admirable zeal to perpetuate patriarchal fashions, proves this
               seeming neglect, a mere <em>oversight</em>: and is an all-sufficient
               guarantee that henceforward they will religiously illustrate in their own
               practice, the beauty of this hitherto neglected patriarchal usage. True, it
               would be an odd codicil to a will, for a slaveholder, after bequeathing to
               <em>some</em> of his children, all his slaves, to add a supplement,
               informing them that such and such and such of them were their
               <em>brothers and sisters</em>. Doubtless it would be at first a sore
               trial also, but what <em>pious</em> slaveholder would not be sustained
               under it by the reflection that he was humbly following in the footsteps of
               his illustrious patriarchal predecessors!

            <p>
               Great reformers must make great sacrifices, and if the world is to be brought
               back to the purity of patriarchal times, upon whom will the ends of the earth
               come, to whom will all trembling hearts and failing eyes spontaneously turn as
               leaders to conduct the forlorn hope through the wilderness to that promised
               land, if not to slaveholders, those disinterested pioneers whose self-denying
               labors have founded far and wide the "patriarchal institution" of
               <i>concubinage</i>, and through evil report and good
               report, have faithfully stamped their own image and superscription, in
               variegated hues, upon the faces of a swarming progeny from generation to
               generation.

               OBJECTION I. "<em>Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be
                  unto his brethren.</em>" Gen. ix. 25.

            </p>
            <p>
               This prophecy of Noah is the <i>vade mecum</i> of
               slaveholders, and they never venture abroad without it; it is a pocket-piece
               for sudden occasion, a keepsake to dote over, a charm to spell-bind
               opposition, and a magnet to draw to their standard "whatsoever worketh
               abomination or maketh a lie." But "cursed be Canaan" is a poor drug to ease a
               throbbing conscience&#8212;a mocking lullaby to unquiet tossings. Those
               who justify negro slavery by the curse on Canaan, <em>assume</em> as
               usual all the points in debate. 1. That <i>slavery</i>
               was prophesied, rather than mere <i>service</i> to others,
               and <i>individual</i> bondage rather than
               <i>national</i> subjection and tribute. 2. That
               the <em>prediction</em> of crime justifies it; or at least absolves those
               whose crimes fulfil it. How piously the Pharaohs might have quoted the
               prophecy, "<em>Thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs,
                  and they shall afflict them four hundred years.</em>" And then, what saints
               were those that crucified the Lord of glory! 3. That the Africans are
               descended from Canaan. Africa was peopled from Egypt and Ethiopia, which
               countries were settled by Mizraim and Cush. For the location and boundaries
               of Canaan's posterity, see Gen. x. 15-19. So a prophecy of evil to one
               people, is quoted to justify its infliction upon another. Perhaps it may be
               argued that Canaan includes all Ham's posterity. If so, the prophecy is yet
               unfulfilled. The other sons of Ham settled Egypt and Assyria, and,
               conjointly with Shem, Persia, and afterward, to some extent, the Grecian
               and Roman empires. The history of these nations gives no verification
               of the prophecy. Whereas, the history of Canaan's descendants
               for more than three thousand years, is a record of its fulfillment.
               First, they were put to tribute by the Israelites; then by the Medes
               and Persians; then by the Macedonians, Grecians and Romans, successively;
               and finally, were subjected by the Ottoman dynasty, where
               they yet remain. Thus Canaan has been for ages the servant mainly of
               Shem and Japhet, and secondarily of the other sons of Ham. It may still
               be objected, that though Canaan alone is <em>named</em>, yet the 22d and
               24th

               verses show the posterity of Ham in general to be meant. "And Ham,
               the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two
               brethren without." "And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what
               his YOUNGER son had done unto him, and said," &amp;c. It is argued that
               this "<em>younger</em> son" cannot be Canaan,
               as he was the <em>grandson</em> of Noah, and therefore it must be
               Ham. We answer, whoever that
               "<em>younger son</em>" was, Canaan alone was
               named in the curse. Besides, the Hebrew word
               <i>Ben</i>, signifies son, grandson, or
               <em>any one</em> of the posterity of an
               individual.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN39"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN39"></a> "<em>Know ye Laban, the</em> SON (grandson) <em>of
                  Nahor</em>?" Gen. xxix. 5. "<em>Mephibosheth the</em> SON (grandson)
               <em>of Saul</em>." 2 Sam. xix. 24; 2 Sam. ix. 6. "<em>The driving of
                  Jehu the</em> SON (grandson) <em>of Nimshi</em>." 2 Kings ix. 20. See
               also Ruth iv. 17; 2 Sam. xxi. 6; Gen. xxxi. 55. Shall we forbid the inspired
               writer to use the same word when speaking of Noah's
               grandson? Further, Ham was not the "<em>younger</em> son." The order of
               enumeration makes him the <em>second</em> son. If it be said that Bible
               usage varies, the order of birth not always being observed in enumerations;
               the reply is, that, enumeration in that order, is the <em>rule</em>, in
               any other order the <em>exception</em>. Besides, if a younger member of a
               family takes precedence of older ones in the family record, it is a mark of
               pre-eminence, either in endowments, or providential instrumentality. Abraham,
               though sixty years younger than his eldest brother, stands first in the
               family genealogy. Nothing in Ham's history shows him pre-eminent; besides,
               the Hebrew word
               <i>H&#259;kk&#257;t&#257;n</i>
               rendered "the <i>younger</i>," means the
               <i>little, small</i>.
               The same word is used in Isa. lx. 22. "A LITTLE ONE <em>shall become
                  a thousand</em>." Isa. xxii. 24. "<em>All vessels of</em> SMALL
               <em>quantity</em>." Ps. cxv. 13. "<em>He will bless them that fear the
                  Lord both</em> SMALL <em>and great</em>." Ex. xviii, 22.
               "<em>But every</em> SMALL <em>matter they shall judge</em>." It would
               be a literal rendering of Gen. ix. 24, if it were translated thus, "when
               Noah knew what his little son,"<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN40"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN40"></a> or grandson
               (<i>B&#275;no
                  H&#259;kk&#257;t&#257;n</i>) "had done unto him, he said cursed be
               Canaan," &amp;c. Further, even if the Africans were the descendants of Canaan,
               the assumption that their enslavement fulfils this prophecy, lacks even
               plausibility, for, only a <em>fraction</em> of the inhabitants of Africa
               have at any time been the slaves of other nations. If the objector say in
               reply, that a large majority of the Africans have always been slaves
               <em>at home</em>, we answer: <em>It is false in point

                  of fact</em>, though zealously bruited often to serve a turn; and
               <em>if it were true</em>, how does it help the argument? The prophecy
               was, "Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be <em>unto
                  his</em> BRETHREN.," not unto <em>himself!</em></p>

                  and he die under his hand, he shall surely be punished. Notwithstanding,
                  if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his
                  money.</em>" Ex. xxi. 20, 21. What was the design of this regulation?
               Was it to grant masters an indulgence to beat servants with impunity,
               and an assurance, that if they beat them to death, the offence should
               not be <em>capital</em>? This is substantially what commentators tell us.
               What Deity do such men worship? Some blood-gorged Moloch, enthroned
               on human hecatombs, and snuffing carnage for incense? Did
               He who thundered from Sinai's flames, "THOU SHALT NOT KILL," offer
               a bounty on <em>murder</em>? Whoever analyzes the Mosaic system, will
               often find a moot court in session, trying law points, settling definitions,
               or laying down rules of evidence. Num. xxxv. 10-22; Deut. xix. 4-6;
               Lev. xxiv. 19-22; Ex. xxi. 18, 19, are some of the cases stated,
               with tests furnished the judges by which to detect <em>the intent</em>,
               in actions brought before them. Their ignorance of judicial proceedings,
               laws of evidence, &amp;c., made such instructions necessary. The detail
               gone into, in the verses quoted, is manifestly to enable them to get at
               the <em>motive</em> and find out whether the master <em>designed</em>
               to kill. 1. "If a man smite his servant with a <em>rod</em>."&#8212;The
               instrument used, gives a clue to the <em>intent</em>. See
               Num. xxxv. 16-18. A <em>rod</em>, not an axe, nor a sword, nor a bludgeon,
               nor any other death-weapon&#8212;hence, from the <em>kind</em> of
               instrument, no design to <em>kill</em> would be inferred; for
               <em>intent</em> to kill would hardly have taken a <em>rod</em> for
               its weapon. But if the servant "<em>die under his hand</em>," then the
               unfitness of the instrument, is point blank against him; for, striking with a
               <em>rod</em> so as to cause death, presupposed very many blows and great
               violence, and this kept up till the death-gasp, showed an
               <em>intent to kill</em>. Hence "He shall <em>surely</em> be punished."
               But if he continued a day or two, the <em>length of time that he
                  lived</em>, the <em>kind</em> of instrument used, and the master's
               pecuniary interest in his <em>life</em>, ("he is his <em>money</em>,")
               all made a strong case of presumptive evidence, showing that the master did
               not <em>design</em> to kill. Further, the word
               <i>n&#257;k&#259;m</i>,
               here rendered <em>punished</em>, occurs thirty-five times in the
               Old Testament, and in almost every place is translated "<em>avenge</em>,"
               in a few, "<i>to take vengeance</i>," or
               "<i>to revenge</i>," and in this instance ALONE,
               "<i>punish</i>." As it stands in our translation, the
               pronoun preceding it, refers to the <i>master</i>,
               whereas it should refer to the <i>crime</i>, and the word

               rendered <i>punished</i>, should have been rendered
               <i>avenged</i>. The meaning
               is this: If a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod, and he die
               under his hand, IT (the death) shall surely be avenged, or literally,
               <em>by avenging it shall be avenged</em>; that is, the <em>death</em>
               of the servant shall be <em>avenged</em> by the <em>death</em> of the
               master. So in the next verse, "If he continue a day or two," his death is not
               to be avenged by the <em>death</em> of the
               <i>master</i>, as in that case the crime was to be
               adjudged <i>manslaughter</i>, and
               not <i>murder</i>. In the following verse, another case
               of personal injury is stated, for which the injurer is to pay
               <em>a sum of money</em>; and yet our
               translators employ the same phraseology in both places! One, an instance
               of deliberate, wanton, killing by piecemeal; the other, an accidental,
               and comparatively slight injury&#8212;of the inflicter, in both cases,
               they say the same thing! Now, just the discrimination to be looked
               for where GOD legislates, is marked in the original. In the case of
               the servant wilfully murdered, He says, "It (the death) shall surely be
               <em>avenged</em>," that is, the life of the wrong doer shall expiate the
               crime. The same word is used in the Old Testament, when the greatest
               wrongs are redressed, by devoting the perpetrators to
               <em>destruction</em>. In the case of the unintentional injury, in the
               following verse, God says, "He shall surely be <em>fined</em>,
               (<i>&#257;n&#259;sh</i>.) "He shall
               <em>pay</em> as the judges determine." The simple meaning of the word
               <i>&#257;n&#259;sh</i>, is to lay a
               fine. It is used in Deut. xxii. 19: "They shall
               <i>amerce</i> him in one hundred
               shekels," and in 2 Chron. xxxvi. 3: "He condemned
               (<i>mulcted</i>) the
               land in a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold." That
               <em>avenging</em> the death of the servant, was neither imprisonment, nor
               stripes, nor a fine but that it was <em>taking the master's life</em> we
               infer, 1. From the <em>use</em> of the word
               <i>n&#257;k&#257;m</i>. See
               Gen. iv. 24; Josh. x. 13; Judg. xv. 7; xvi. 28; 1 Sam. xiv. 24; xviii. 25;
               xxv. 31; 2 Sam. iv. 8; Judg. v. 2; 1 Sam. xxv. 26-33. 2. From the express
               statute, Lev. xxiv. 17: "He that killeth ANY man shall surely be put to
               death." Also, Num. xxxv. 30, 31: "Whoso killeth ANY person, the murderer shall
               be put to death. Moreover, ye shall take NO SATISFACTION for the life of a
               murderer which is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death."
               3. The Targum of Jonathan gives the verse thus, "Death by the sword
               shall surely be adjudged." The Targum of Jerusalem, "Vengeance
               shall be taken for him to the <em>uttermost</em>." Jarchi, the same. The
               Samaritan version: "He shall die the death." Again, the clause "for
               he is his money," is quoted to prove that the servant is his master's
               property, and therefore, if he died, the master was not to be punished.
               The assumption is, that the phrase, "HE IS HIS MONEY," proves not only
               that the servant is <em>worth money</em> to the master, but that he is an
               <em>article

                  of property</em>. If the advocates of slavery insist upon taking this
               principle of interpretation into the Bible, and turning it loose, let them
               stand and draw in self-defence. If they endorse for it at one point, they must
               stand sponsors all around the circle. It will be too late to cry for quarter
               when its stroke clears the table, and tilts them among the sweepings beneath.
               The Bible abounds with such expressions as the following: "This
               (bread) <em>is</em> my body;" "all they (the Israelites) <em>are</em>
               brass and tin;" this (water) <em>is</em> the blood of the men who went in
               jeopardy of their lives;" "the Lord God <em>is</em> a sun;" "the seven
               good ears <em>are</em> seven years;" "the tree of the field
               <em>is</em> man's life;" "God <em>is</em> a consuming fire;" "he
               <em>is</em> his money," &amp;c. A passion for the exact
               <em>literalities</em> of the Bible is too amiable, not to be gratified in
               this case. The words in the original are
               (<i>K&aacute;spo-hu</i>,) "his
               <i>silver</i> is he." The objector's principle of
               interpretation is a philosopher's stone! Its miracle touch transmutes
               five feet eight inches of flesh and bones into <em>solid silver</em>!
               Quite a <em>permanent</em> servant, if not so nimble
               withal&#8212;reasoning against <em>"forever</em>,"
               is forestalled henceforth, and, Deut. xxiii. 15, quite outwitted.
               The obvious meaning of the phrase, "<em>He is his money</em>," is, he is
               <em>worth money</em> to his master, and since, if the master had killed
               him, it would have taken money out of his pocket, the <em>pecuniary
                  loss</em>, the <em>kind of instrument used</em>, and <em>the fact of
                  his living sometime after the injury</em>, (if the master
               <em>meant</em> to kill, he would be likely to <em>do</em> it while
               about it.) all together make a strong case of presumptive evidence clearing
               the master from <em>intent to kill</em>. But let us look at the
               objector's <em>inferences</em>. One is, that as the master might dispose
               of his <em>property</em> as he pleased, he was not to be punished, if he
               destroyed it. Whether the servant died under the master's hand, or after a day
               or two, he was <em>equally</em> his property, and the objector admits that
               in the <em>first</em> case the master is to be "surely punished" for
               destroying <em>his own property</em>! The other inference
               is, that since the continuance of a day or two, cleared the master
               of <em>intent to kill</em>, the loss of the servant would be a sufficient
               punishment for inflicting the injury which caused his death. This inference
               makes the Mosaic law false to its own principles. A <em>pecuniary
                  loss</em> was no part of the legal claim, where a person took the
               <em>life</em> of another. In such case, the law spurned money, whatever
               the sum. God would not cheapen human life, by balancing it with such a weight.
               "Ye shall take NO SATISFACTION for the life of a murderer, but he
               shall surely be put to death." Num. xxxv. 31. Even in excusable
               homicide, where an axe slipped from the helve and killed a man, no
               sum of money availed to release from confinement in the city of refuge,
               until the death of the High Priest. Num. xxxv. 32. The doctrine

               that the loss of the servant would be a penalty <em>adequate</em> to the
               desert of the master, admits his <em>guilt</em> and his desert of
               <em>some</em> punishment, and it prescribes a kind of punishment, rejected
               by the law, in all cases where man took the life of man, whether with or
               without intent to kill. In short, the objector annuls an integral part of the
               system&#8212;makes a <em>new</em> law, and coolly metes out such penalty
               as he thinks fit. Divine legislation revised and improved! The master who
               struck out his servant's tooth, whether intentionally or not, was required to
               set him free. The <em>pecuniary loss</em> to the master was the same as
               though he had killed him. Look at the two cases. A master beats his servant
               so that he dies of his wounds; another accidentally strikes out his
               servant's tooth,&#8212;<em>the pecuniary loss of both masters is the
                  same</em>. If the loss of the servant's services is punishment sufficient
               for the crime of killing him, would God command the same punishment for the
               accidental knocking out of a <em>tooth</em>? Indeed, unless the injury was
               done <em>inadvertently</em>, the loss of the servant's services was only
               a part of the punishment&#8212;mere reparation to the <em>individual</em>
               for injury done; the main punishment, that strictly
               <i>judicial</i>, was reparation to the
               <em>community</em>. To set the servant <em>free</em>, and thus
               proclaim his injury, his right to redress, and the measure of
               it&#8212;answered not the ends of <em>public</em> justice. The
               law made an example of the offender, that "those that remain might
               hear and fear." "If a man cause a blemish in his neighbor, as he
               hath done, so shall it be done unto him. Breach for breach, eye for
               eye, tooth for tooth. Ye shall have one manner of law as well for the
               STRANGER as for one of your own country." Lev. xxiv. 19, 20, 22.
               Finally, if a master smote out <em>his</em> servant's tooth, the law smote
               out his tooth&#8212;thus redressing the <em>public</em> wrong; and it
               cancelled the servant's obligation to the master, thus giving some
               compensation for the injury done, and exempting him from perilous liabilities
               in future.

               1. "BONDMEN." The fact that servants from the heathen are called
               "<i>bondmen</i>," while others are called
               "<i>servants</i>," is quoted as proof
               that the former were slaves. As the caprices of King James' translators
               were not inspired, we need stand in no special awe of them. The
               word here rendered bondmen is uniformly rendered servants elsewhere.
               The Hebrew word
               "<i>&#277;b&#277;dh</i>," the plural
               of which is here translated "<i>bondmen</i>," is often
               applied to Christ. "Behold my <i>servant</i>
               (bondman, slave?) whom I uphold." Isa. xlii. 1. "Behold my
               <i>servant</i> (Christ) shall deal prudently."
               Isa. lii. 13. "And he said it is a light thing that thou (Christ) shouldst be
               my <i>servant</i>." Isa. xlix. 6. "To a
               <i>servant</i> of rulers." Isa. xlix. 7. "By his knowledge
               shall my righteous <i>servant</i> (Christ) justify many."
               Is. liii. 11. "Behold I will bring forth my
               <i>servant</i> the BRANCH." Zech. iii. 8. In 1 Kings
               xii. 6, 7, it is applied to King Rehoboam. "And they spake unto
               him, saying if thou wilt be a <i>servant</i> unto this
               people, then they will be thy <i>servants</i> forever."
               In 2 Chron. xii. 7, 8, 9, 13, to the king and all the nation. The word is
               used to designate those who perform service for <em>individuals or
                  families</em>, about thirty-five times in the Old Testament.
               To designate <i>tributaries</i> about twenty-five times.
               To designate the <i>subjects of government</i>, about
               thirty-three times. To designate the worshippers both of the true God, and of
               false gods, about seventy times. It is also used in salutations and courteous
               addresses nearly one hundred times. In fine, the word is applied to all
               persons doing service for others, and that <em>merely to designate them as
                  the performers of such service</em>, whatever it might be, or whatever the
               ground on which it might be rendered. To argue from the fact, of this word
               being used to designate domestic servants, that they were made servants by
               <em>force</em>, worked without pay, and held as articles
               of property, is such a gross assumption and absurdity as to
               make formal refutation ridiculous. We repeat what has been shown
               above, that the word rendered bondmen in Lev. xxv. 44, is used to
               point out persons rendering service for others, totally irrespective of
               the principle on which that service was rendered; as is manifest from
               the fact that it is applied indiscriminately to tributaries, to domestics, to
               all the subjects of governments, to magistrates, to all governmental
               officers, to younger sons&#8212;defining their relation to the first born, who
               is called <em>lord</em> and <em>ruler</em>&#8212;to prophets, to
               kings, and to the Messiah. To argue from the meaning of the word
               <i>&#277;b&#277;dh</i> as used in the
               Old Testament, that those to whom it was applied rendered service against

               their will, and without pay, does violence to the scripture use of the
               term, sets at nought all rules of interpretation, and outrages common
               sense. If <em>any</em> inference as to the meaning of the term is to be
               drawn from the condition and relations of the various classes of persons, to
               whom it is applied, the only legitimate one would seem to be, that the
               term designates a person who renders service to another in return for
               something of value received from him. The same remark applies to
               the Hebrew verb <i>&#259;b&#259;dh</i>,
               to serve, answering to the noun
               <i>&#277;b&#277;dh</i> (servant).
               It is used in the Old Testament to describe the
               <i>serving</i> of
               tributaries, of worshippers, of domestics, of Levites, of sons to a father,
               of younger brothers to the elder, of subjects to a ruler, of hirelings, of
               soldiers, of public officers to the government, of a host to his guests,
               &amp;c. Of these it is used to describe the serving of
               <i>worshippers</i> more than forty times, of
               <i>tributaries</i>, about thirty five, and of servants or
               domestics, about <em>ten</em>.

            <p>
               If the Israelites not only held slaves, but multitudes of them, if Abraham
               had thousands, and if they abounded under the Mosaic system,
               why had their language no word that <em>meant slave</em>? That language
               must be wofully poverty-stricken, which has no signs to represent the
               most common and familiar objects and conditions. To represent by
               the same word, and without figure, property, and the owner of that
               property, is a solecism. Ziba was an
               "<i>&#277;b&#277;dh</i>," yet he
               "<i>owned</i>" (!) twenty
               <i>&#277;b&#277;dhs</i>! In our
               language, we have both <i>servant</i> and
               <i>slave</i>. Why? Because we have both the
               <em>things</em>, and need <em>signs</em> for them. If
               the tongue had a sheath, as swords have scabbards, we should have
               some <em>name</em> for it: but our dictionaries give us none. Why? Because
               there is no such <em>thing</em>. But the objector asks, "Would not the
               Israelites use their word
               <i>&#277;b&#277;dh</i> if they spoke
               of the slave of a heathen?" Answer. Their <i>national</i>
               servants or tributaries, are spoken of frequently, but domestics servants so
               rarely, that no necessity existed, even if they were slaves, for coining a
               new word. Besides, the fact of their being domestics, under <em>heathen
                  laws and usages</em>, proclaimed their liabilities; their
               <em>locality</em> made a <em>specific</em> term unnecessary. But if
               the Israelites had not only <i>servants</i>, but a
               multitude of <i>slaves</i>, a <em>word meaning
                  slave</em>, would have been indispensible for every day convenience.
               Further, the laws of the Mosaic system were so many sentinels on the
               outposts to warn off foreign practices. The border ground of Canaan,
               was quarantine ground, enforcing the strictest non-intercourse in
               usages between the without and the within.

               2. "BUY." The <em>buying</em> of servants, is discussed at length.
               pp. <a href="#E4r4_17" class="ref">17</a>-<a href="#E4r4_23" class="ref">23</a>.
               To that discussion the reader is referred. We will add in this place

               but a single consideration. This regulation requiring the Israelites to
               <i>"buy"</i> servants of the heathen, prohibited their
               taking them without buying. <i>Buying</i> supposes two
               parties: a <i>price</i> demanded by one and
               paid by the other, and consequently, the <em>consent</em> of both buyer
               and seller, to the transaction. Of course the command to the Israelites to
               <i>buy</i> servants of the heathen, prohibited their
               getting them unless they first got <em>somebody's</em> consent to the
               transaction, and paid to <em>somebody</em> a fair equivalent. Now, who
               were these <em>somebodies</em>? This at least is plain, they were not
               <i>Israelites</i>, but heathen. "Of <em>them</em>
               shall ye buy." Who then were these <em>somebodies</em>, whose right was
               so paramount, that <em>their</em> consent must be got and the price paid
               must go into <em>their</em> pockets? Were they the persons themselves who
               became servants, or some <em>other</em> persons. "Some <em>other</em>
               persons to be sure," says the objector, "the countrymen or the neighbors of
               those who become servants." Ah! this then is the import of the Divine command
               to the Israelites.

               "When you go among the heathen round about to get a man to work
               for you, I straightly charge you to go first to his <em>neighbors</em>,
               get <em>their</em> consent that you may have him, settle the terms with
               <em>them</em>, and pay to them a fair equivalent. If it is not
               <em>their</em> choice to let him go, I charge you not to take him on your
               peril. If <em>they</em> consent, and you pay <em>them</em> the
               full value of his labor, then you may go and catch the man and drag
               him home with you, and make him work for you, and I will bless you
               in the work of your hands and you shall eat of the fat of the land. As
               to the man himself, his choice is nothing, and you need give him nothing
               for his work: but take care and pay his <em>neighbors</em> well for him,
               and respect <em>their</em> free choice in taking him, for to deprive a
               heathen man by force and without pay of the <em>use of himself</em> is
               well pleasing in my sight, but to deprive his heathen neighbors of the use
               of him is that abominable thing which my soul hateth."

               3. "FOREVER." This is quoted to prove that servants were to serve
               during their life time, and their posterity from generation to
               generation.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN41"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN41"></a> No such idea is contained
               in the passage. The word "forever," instead of defining the length of
               <i>individual</i> service, proclaims the permanence
               of the regulation laid down in the two verses preceding, namely,
               that their <i>permanent domestics</i> should be of the
               <i>Strangers</i>, and not of the Israelites; it declares
               the duration of that general provision. As if God had said, "You shall
               <em>always</em> get your <i>permanent</i> laborers
               from the nations round about you; your servants shall <em>always</em> be
               of that

               class of persons." As it stands in the original, it is
               plain&#8212;"<em>Forever of them shall ye serve yourselves</em>." This is
               the literal rendering.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN41"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN41">A</a>: One would think that the explicit
               testimony of our Lord should for ever forestall all cavil on this point.
               "<em>The servant abideth not in the house</em> FOR EVER,
               but the Son, abideth ever." John viii. 35.
            </p>
            <p>
               That "<em>forever</em>" refers to the permanent relations of a
               <i>community</i>, rather than to the services of
               <i>individuals</i>, is a fair inference from the
               form of the expression, "Both thy bondmen, &amp;c., shall be of the
               <i>heathen</i>. OF THEM shall ye buy." "They shall be
               your possession." "THEY shall be your bondmen forever." "But over your
               brethren the CHILDREN OF ISRAEL," &amp;c. To say nothing of the uncertainty
               of <em>these individuals</em> surviving those <em>after</em> whom
               they are to live, the language used applies more naturally to a
               <i>body</i> of people, than to
               <i>individual</i> servants. Besides
               <i>perpetual</i> service cannot be argued from the term
               <i>forever</i>. The ninth and tenth verses of the same
               chapter limit it absolutely by the jubilee. "Then thou shalt cause the trumpet
               of the jubilee to sound * * throughout ALL your land." "And ye shall
               proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto ALL the inhabitants thereof."
               It may be objected that "inhabitants" here means
               <i>Israelitish</i> inhabitants
               alone. The command is, "Proclaim liberty throughout all
               the land unto ALL <em>the inhabitants thereof</em>." Besides, in the sixth
               verse, there is an enumeration of the different classes of the inhabitants, in
               which servants and Strangers are included; and in all the regulations
               of the jubilee, and the sabbatical year, the Strangers are included in the
               precepts, prohibitions, and promises. Again: the year of jubilee was
               ushered in by the day of atonement. What did these institutions show
               forth? The day of atonement prefigured the atonement of Christ, and
               the year of jubilee, the gospel jubilee. And did they prefigure an atonement
               and a jubilee to <em>Jews</em> only? Were they types of sins remitted,
               and of salvation proclaimed to the nation of Israel
               alone? Is there no redemption for us Gentiles in these ends of the earth, and
               is our hope presumption and impiety? Did that old partition wall survive the
               shock that made earth quake, and hid the sun, burst graves and rocks, and
               rent the temple veil? and did the Gospel only rear it higher to thunder
               direr perdition from its frowning battlements on all without? No!
               The God of OUR salvation lives. "Good tidings of great joy shall be to
               ALL people." One shout shall swell from all the ransomed, "Thou
               hast redeemed us unto God by thy blood out of EVERY kindred, and
               tongue, and people, and nation."

            </p>
            <p>
               To deny that the blessings of the jubilee extended to the servants from
               the <i>Gentiles</i>, makes Christianity
               <i>Judaism</i>.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN42"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN42"></a> It not only eclipses the

               glory of the Gospel, but strikes out its sun. The refusal to release
               servants at the jubilee falsified and disannulled a grand leading type of
               the atonement, and was a libel on the doctrine of Christ's redemption.
               But even if <em>forever</em> did refer to
               <i>individual</i> service, we have ample precedents
               for limiting the term by the jubilee. The same word defines
               the length of time which <i>Jewish</i> servants served who
               did not go out at the end of their six years' term. And all admit that they
               went out at the jubilee. Ex. xxi. 2-6; Deut. xv. 12-17. The 23d verse of the
               same chapter is quoted to prove that "<em>forever</em>" in the 46th verse
               extends beyond the jubilee. "The land shall not be sold FOREVER, for
               the land is mine"&#8212;since it would hardly be used in different senses in
               the same general connection. As <i>forever</i>, in the
               46th verse, respects the <em>general arrangement</em>, and not
               <i>individual service</i> the objection does
               not touch the argument. Besides, in the 46th verse, the word used is
               <i>Olam</i>, meaning
               <i>throughout the period</i>, whatever that may be.
               Whereas in the 23d verse, it is
               <i>Tsemithuth</i>, meaning, a
               <i>cutting off</i>, or <i>to be cut
                  off</i>; and the import of it is, that the owner of an inheritance shall
               not forfeit his <i>proprietorship</i> of it; though it
               may for a time pass from his control into the hands of his creditors or
               others, yet the owner shall be permitted to <i>redeem</i>
               it, and even if that be not done, it shall not be "<i>cut
                  off</i>," but shall revert to him at the jubilee.

               Strangers not being released by the proclamation of liberty on the morning of
               the jubilee, they were the only persons who were, as a body, released by it.
               The rule regulating the service of Hebrew servants was, "Six
               years shall he serve, and in the seventh year he shall go out free." The
               <i>free holders</i> who had "fallen into decay," and had
               in consequence mortgaged their inheritances to their more prosperous
               neighbors, and become in some sort their servants, were released by the
               jubilee, and again resumed their inheritances. This was the only class of
               Jewish servants (and it could not have been numerous,) which was released by
               the jubilee; all others went out at the close of their six years'
               term.

               3. "INHERITANCE AND POSSESSION." "Ye shall take them as an
               INHERITANCE for your children after you to inherit them for a POSSESSION.
               This, as has been already remarked refers to the <em>nations</em>, and
               not to the <em>individual</em> servants procured from the senations. The
               holding of servants as a <i>possession</i> is discussed
               at large pp. <a href="#E4r4_47" class="ref">47</a>-<a href="#E4r4_64" class="ref">64</a>. To
               what is there advanced we here subjoin a few brief considerations. We
               have already shown, that servants could not he held as a
               <i>property</i> possession, and inheritance; that they
               became such of their <em>own accord</em>, were paid wages, released from
               their regular labor nearly <em>half the days in each year</em>,
               thoroughly <em>instructed</em> and <em>protected</em> in all their
               personal, social, and religious rights, equally with their masters. All
               remaining, after these ample reservations, would be small temptation, either
               to the

               lust of power or of lucre; a profitable "possession" and "inheritance,"
               truly! What if our American slaves were all placed in <em>just such a
                  condition</em>! Alas, for that soft, melodious circumlocution, "OUR PECULIAR
               species of property!" Verily, emphasis would be cadence, and
               euphony and irony meet together! What eager snatches at mere
               words, and bald technics, irrespective of connection, principles of
               construction, Bible usages, or limitations of meaning by other
               passages&#8212;and all to eke out such a sense as sanctifies existing usages,
               thus making God pander for lust. The words
               <i>nahal</i>
               and <i>nahala</i>, inherit and
               inheritance, by no means necessarily signify
               <i>articles of property</i>. "The people
               answered the king and said, "we have none
               <i>inheritance</i> in the son
               of Jesse." 2 Chron. x. 16. Did they mean gravely to disclaim the
               holding of their king as an article of <i>property</i>?
               "Children are an <i>heritage</i>
               (inheritance) of the Lord." Ps. cxxvii. 3. "Pardon our iniquity,
               and take us for thine <i>inheritance</i>." Ex. xxxiv. 9.
               When God pardons his enemies, and adopts them as children, does he make them
               <i>articles of property</i>? Are forgiveness, and
               chattel-making, synonymes? "<em>I</em> am their
               <i>inheritance</i>." Ezek. xliv. 28. "I shall give thee
               the heathen for thine <i>inheritance</i>." Ps. ii. 18.
               See also Deut. iv. 20; Josh. xiii. 33; Ps. lxxxii. 8; lxxviii. 62, 71;
               Prov. xiv. 18.

            <p>
               The question whether the servants were a
               PROPERTY-"<i>possession</i>," has been already discussed,
               pp. <a href="#E4r4_47" class="ref">47</a>-<a href="#E4r4_64" class="ref">64</a>, we need add in
               this place but a word. As an illustration of the condition of servants from
               the heathen that were the "possession" of Israelitish families, and of the
               way in which they became servants, the reader is referred to Isa. xiv.
               1, 2. "For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
               Israel, and set them in their own land; and the strangers will be
               <em>joined</em> with them, and <em>they shall CLEAVE to the house of
                  Jacob</em>. And the people shall take them and bring them to their place,
               and the house of Israel shall <i>possess</i> them in the
               land of the Lord for servants and handmaids; and they shall take them
               captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over the oppressors."

            </p>
            <p>
               We learn from these verses, 1st. That these servants which were to
               be "<i>possessed</i>" by the Israelites, were to be
               "joined with them," i.e., become proselytes to their religion. 2d. That they
               should "CLEAVE to the house of Jacob," i.e., that they would forsake their
               own people voluntarily, attach themselves to the Israelites as servants, and
               of their own free choice leave home and friends, to accompany them on their
               return, and to take up their permanent abode with them, in the same
               manner that Ruth accompanied Naomi from Moab to the land of Israel,
               and that the "souls gotten" by Abraham in Padanaram, accompanied him

               when he left it and went to Canaan. "And the house of Israel shall
               <i>possess</i> them for servants," i.e. shall
               <em>have</em> them for servants.

            </p>
            <p>
               In the passage under consideration, "they shall be your
               <i>possession</i>," the original word translated
               "possession" is <i>ahuzza</i>. The same
               word is used in Gen. xlvii. 11. "And Joseph placed his father and his
               brethren, and gave them a <i>possession</i> in the land
               of Egypt." Gen. xlvii. 11. In what sense was Goshen the
               <i>possession</i> of the Israelites? Answer,
               in the sense of <em>having it to live in</em>, not in the sense of having
               it as <i>owners</i>. In what sense were the Israelites to
               <i>possess</i> these nations, and <em>take them</em>
               as an <em>inheritance for their children</em>? Answer, they possessed
               them as a permanent source of supply for domestic or household servants.
               And this relation to these nations was to go down to posterity
               as a standing regulation, having the certainty and regularity of a descent
               by inheritance. The sense of the whole regulation may be given
               thus: "Thy permanent domestics, which thou shalt have, shall be of
               the nations that are round about you, of <em>them</em> shall ye buy male
               and female domestics." "Moreover of the children of the foreigners that do
               sojourn among you, of <em>them</em> shall ye buy, and of their families
               that are with you, which they begat in your land, and <em>they</em> shall
               be your permanent resource." "And ye shall take them as a
               <em>perpetual</em> source of supply to whom your children after you shall
               resort for servants. ALWAYS, <em>of them</em> shall ye serve yourselves."
               The design of the passage is manifest from its structure. So far from being a
               permission to purchase slaves, it was a prohibition to employ Israelites for
               a certain term and in a certain grade of service, and to point out the
               <em>class</em> of persons from which they were to get their supply of
               servants, and the <em>way</em> in which they were to get
               them.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN43"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN43"></a></p>

               verses, says, "It must be observed that it was prohibited to SUBJECT

               As only <em>one</em> class is called "<i>hired</i>,"
               it is inferred that servants of the other class were <em>not paid</em>
               for their labor. That God, while thundering anathemas against those who "used
               their neighbor's service without wages," granted a special indulgence to his
               chosen people to force others to work, and rob them of earnings, provided
               always, in selecting their victims, they spared "the gentlemen of property
               and standing," and pounced only upon the strangers and the common
               people. The inference that "<i>hired</i>" is synonymous
               with <i>paid</i>, and that those servants not
               <em>called</em> "hired," were <em>not paid</em> for their labor, is
               a mere assumption. The meaning of the English verb to
               <i>hire</i>, is to procure for a
               <i>temporary</i> use at a certain price&#8212;to engage
               a person to temporary service for wages. That is also the meaning of the
               Hebrew word "<i>saukar</i>." It is not
               used when the procurement of <i>permanent</i>
               service is spoken of. Now, we ask, would <i>permanent</i>
               servants, those who constituted a stationary part of the family,
               have been designated by the same term that marks
               <i>temporary</i> servants?
               The every-day distinctions in this matter, are familiar
               as table-talk. In many families the domestics perform only the
               <em>regular</em> work. Whatever is occasional merely, as the washing of a
               family, is done by persons hired expressly for the purpose. The familiar
               distinction between the two classes, is "servants," and "hired
               help," (not <i>paid</i> help.) <em>Both</em> classes
               are <i>paid</i>. One is permanent, and the other
               occasional and temporary, and <em>therefore</em> in this case
               called "hired."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN44"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN44"></a> A variety of particulars are
               recorded distinguishing, <i>hired</i> from
               <i>bought</i> servants. 1. Hired servants were paid daily
               at the close of their work. Lev. xix. 13; Deut. xxiv. 14, 15; Job. vii.
               2; Matt. xx. 8. "<i>Bought</i>" servants were paid in
               advance, (a reason for their being called <i>bought</i>,)
               and those that went out at the seventh

               year received a <i>gratuity</i>. Deut. xv. 12, 13.
               2. The "hired" were paid <i>in money</i>, the "bought"
               received their <i>gratuity</i>, at least, in
               grain, cattle, and the product of the vintage. Deut. xv. 14.
               3. The "hired" <em>lived</em> in their own families, the "bought" were a
               part of their masters' families. 4. The "hired" supported their families
               out of their wages; the "bought" and their families were supported
               by the master <em>beside</em> their wages. 5. Hired servants were expected
               to work more <em>constantly</em>, and to have more <em>working
                  hours</em> in the day than the bought servants. This we infer from the fact,
               that "a hireling's day," was a sort of proverbial phrase, meaning a
               <i>full</i> day. No subtraction of time being made from
               it. So <i>a hireling's year</i> signifies an
               entire year without abatement. Job. vii. 1; xiv. 6; Isa. xvi. 14; xxi. 16.

            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN44"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN44">A</a>: To suppose a servant robbed of his
               earnings because he is not called a <i>hired</i>
               servant, is profound induction! If I employ a man at twelve dollars a month
               to work my farm, he is my "<i>hired</i>" man, but if
               <em>I give him such a portion of the crop</em>, or in other words, if he
               works my farm "<i>on shares</i>," every
               farmer knows that he is no longer called a "<i>hired</i>"
               man. Yet he works the same farm, in the same way, at the same times, and with
               the same teams and tools; and does the same amount of work in the year, and
               perhaps clears twenty dollars a month, instead of twelve. Now as he is no
               longer called "hired," and as he still works my farm, suppose my neighbors
               sagely infer, that since he is not my "<i>hired</i>"
               laborer, I <em>rob</em> him of his earnings, and with all the gravity of
               owls, pronounce their oracular decision, and hoot it abroad. My neighbors are
               deep divers! like some theological professors, they go not only to the bottom
               but come up covered with the tokens.

               The "bought" servants, were, <em>as a class, superior to the
                  hired</em>&#8212;were more trust-worthy, were held in higher estimation,
               had greater privileges, and occupied a more elevated station in society. 1.
               They were intimately incorporated with the family of the master,
               were guests at family festivals, and social solemnities, from which
               hired servants were excluded. Lev. xxii. 10, 11; Ex. xii. 43, 45.
               2. Their interests were far more identified with those of their masters'
               family. They were often, actually or prospectively, heirs of their masters'
               estates, as in the case of Eliezer, of Ziba, and the sons of
               Bilhah, and Zilpah. When there were no sons, or when they were
               unworthy, bought servants were made heirs. Prov. xvii. 2. We
               find traces of this usage in the New Testament. "But when the
               husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves saying, this
               is the <em>heir</em>, come let us kill him, <em>that the inheritance
                  may be ours</em>." Luke xx. 14. In no instance does a
               <i>hired</i> servant inherit his master's
               estate. 3. Marriages took place between servants and their
               master's daughters. "Sheshan had a <i>servant</i>, an
               Egyptian, whose name was Jarha. And Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his
               servant to wife." 1 Chron. ii. 34, 35. There is no instance of a
               <i>hired</i> servant forming such an alliance. 4. Bought
               servants and their descendants were treated with the same affection and
               respect as the other members of the family.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN45"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN45"></a> The treatment of Abraham's servants.
               Gen. xxiv. and xviii. 1-7; the intercourse between Gideon and Phurah

               Judg. vii. 10, 11; Saul and his servant, 1 Sam. ix. 5, 22; Jonathan
               and his servant, 1 Sam. xiv. 1-14, and Elisha and Gehazi are
               illustrations. The tenderness exercised towards home-born servants
               or the children of <i>handmaids</i>, and the strength of
               the tie that bound them to the family, are employed by the Psalmist to
               illustrate the regard of God for him, his care over him, and his own endearing
               relation to him, when in the last extremity he prays, "Save the son of thy
               <i>handmaid</i>." Ps. lxxxvi. 16. So also in Ps. cxvi. 16.
               Oh Lord, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thy
               <i>handmaid</i>. Also, Jer. ii. 14. Is Israel a servant?
               Is he a <i>home-born</i>?<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN46"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN46"></a> WHY IS HE SPOILED? No such tie seems to have existed
               between <i>hired</i> servants and their masters. Their
               untrustworthiness was proverbial. John x. 12, 13. They were reckoned at but
               half the value of bought servants. Deut. xv. 18. None but the
               <em>lowest class</em> of the people engaged
               as hired servants, and the kinds of labor assigned to them required
               little knowledge and skill. No persons seem to have become
               hired servants except such as were forced to it from extreme poverty.
               The hired servant is called "poor and needy," and the reason assigned
               by God why he should be paid as soon as he had finished his work
               is, "For <em>he is poor</em>, and setteth his heart upon it."
               Deut. xxiv. 14, 15. See also, 1 Sam. ii. 5. Various passages show the low
               repute and trifling character of the class from which they were hired.
               Judg. ix. 4; 1 Sam. ii. 5. The superior condition of bought servants is
               manifest in the high trust confided to them, and in their dignity and
               authority in the household. In no instance is a
               <i>hired</i> servant thus distinguished.
               The <i>bought</i> servant is manifestly the master's
               representative in the family, sometimes with plenipotentiary powers over adult
               children, even negotiating marriage for them. Abraham adjured his servant,
               not to take a wife for Isaac of the daughters of the Canaanites. The
               servant himself selected the individual. Servants exercised discretionary
               power in the management of their masters' estates, "And the servant
               took ten camels of the camels of his master, <em>for all the goods of his
                  master were in his hand</em>." Gen. xxiv. 10. The reason assigned
               is not that such was Abraham's direction, but that the servant
               had discretionary control. Servants had also discretionary power

               in the <em>disposal of property</em>. Gen. xxiv. 22, 30, 53. The condition
               of Ziba in the house of Mephibosheth, is a case in point. So is Prov.
               xvii. 2. Distinct traces of this estimation are to be found in the New
               Testament, Matt. xxiv. 45; Luke xii. 42, 44. So in the parable of
               the talents, the master seems to have set up each of his servants in
               trade with a large capital. The unjust steward had large
               <em>discretionary</em> power, was "accused of wasting his master's
               goods," and manifestly regulated with his debtors the <em>terms</em>
               of settlement. Luke xvi. 4-8. Such trusts were never reposed in
               <i>hired</i> servants.

               The inferior condition of <i>hired</i> servants, is
               illustrated in the parable of the prodigal son. When he came to himself, the
               memory of his home, and of the abundance enjoyed by even the
               <em>lowest</em> class of servants in his father's household, while he was
               perishing with hunger among the swine and husks, so filled him with anguish
               at the contrast, that he exclaimed, "How many <i>hired</i>
               servants of my father, have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with
               hunger." His proud heart broke. "I will arise," he cried, "and go to my
               father;" and then to assure his father of the depth of his humility, resolved
               to add; "Make me as one of thy <i>hired</i> servants."
               If <i>hired</i> servants were the <em>superior</em>
               class&#8212;to bespeak the situation, savored little of that sense of
               unworthiness that seeks the dust with hidden face, and cries "unclean."
               Unhumbled nature <em>climbs</em>; or if it falls, clings fast, where first
               it may. Humility sinks of its own weight, and in the lowest deep, digs lower.
               The design of the parable was to illustrate on the one hand, the joy of
               God, as he beholds afar off, the returning sinner "seeking an injured
               father's face," who runs to clasp and bless him with an unchiding welcome;
               and on the other, the contrition of the penitent, turning homeward
               with tears from his wanderings, his stricken spirit breaking with
               its ill-desert he sobs aloud, "The lowest place, <em>the lowest
                  place</em>, I can abide no other." Or in those inimitable words, "Father I
               have sinned against Heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be
               called thy son; make me as one of thy HIRED servants." The supposition
               that <i>hired</i> servants were the <em>highest</em>
               class, takes from the parable an element of winning beauty and pathos.

            </p>
            <p>
               It is manifest to every careful student of the Bible, that <em>one</em>
               class of servants, was on terms of equality with the children and other
               members of the family. Hence the force of Paul's declaration, Gal. iv. 1, "Now
               I say unto you, that the heir, so long as he is a child, DIFFERETH NOTHING
               FROM A SERVANT, though he be lord of all." If this were the
               <i>hired</i> class, the prodigal was a sorry specimen of
               humility. Would our Lord have put such language upon the lips of one held up
               by himself,

               as a model of gospel humility, to illustrate its deep sense of all ill-desert?
               If this is <em>humility</em>, put it on stilts, and set it a strutting,
               while pride takes lessons, and blunders in aping it.

               Israelites and Strangers belonged indiscriminately to <em>each</em> class
               of the servants, the <i>bought</i> and the
               <i>hired</i>. That those in the former class,
               whether Jews or Strangers, rose to honors and authority in the family
               circle, which were not conferred on <i>hired</i> servants,
               has been shown. It should be added, however, that in the enjoyment of
               privileges, merely <i>political</i>, the hired servants
               from the <i>Israelites</i>, were more favored than
               even the bought servants from the <i>Strangers</i>. No
               one from the Strangers, however wealthy or highly endowed, was eligible to
               the highest office, nor could he own the soil. This last disability seems to
               have been one reason for the different periods of service required of the two
               classes of bought servants. The Israelite was to serve six years&#8212;the
               Stranger until the jubilee. As the Strangers could not own the
               soil, nor houses, except within walled towns, they would naturally attach
               themselves to Israelitish families. <a name="E4r4_Lev25_39_Isrserv"></a>Those
               who were wealthy, or skilled in manufactures, instead of becoming servants
               would need servants for their own use, and as inducements for the Strangers to
               become servants to the Israelites, were greater than persons of their own
               nation could hold out to them, these wealthy Strangers would naturally
               procure the poorer Israelites for servants. Lev. xxv. 47. In a word,
               such was the political condition of the Strangers, that the Jewish polity
               offered a virtual bounty, to such as would become permanent servants,
               and thus secure those privileges already enumerated, and for their
               children in the second generation a permanent inheritance. Ezek.
               xlvii. 21-23. None but the monied aristocracy would be likely to
               decline such offers. On the other hand, the Israelites, owning all the
               soil, and an inheritance of land being a sacred possession, to hold it
               free of incumbrance was with every Israelite, a delicate point, both of
               family honor and personal character. 1 Kings xxi. 3. Hence, to
               forego the control of one's inheritance, after the division of the paternal
               domain, or to be kept out of it after having acceded to it, was a
               burden grievous to be borne.
               <a name="E4r4_Lev25_39_reas7yr"></a>To mitigate as much as possible such a
               calamity, the law released the Israelitish servant at the end of
               six<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN47"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN47"></a>
               years; as, during that time&#8212;if of the first class&#8212;the partition of
               the patrimonial land might have taken place or, if of the second, enough
               money might have been earned to disencumber his estate, and thus he
               might assume his station as a lord of the soil. If neither contingency
               had occurred, then after another six years the opportunity was again
               offered, and so on, until the jubilee. <a name="E4r4_Lev25_39_lngreas"></a>So
               while strong motives urged the Israelite to discontinue his service as soon as
               the exigency had passed which made him a servant, every consideration impelled
               the <i>Stranger</i> to <em>prolong</em> his term of
               service;<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN48"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN48"></a> and the same kindness which
               dictated the law of six years' service for the Israelite, assigned as the
               general rule, a much longer period to the Gentile servant, who had
               every inducement to protract the term. It should be borne in mind,
               that adult Jews ordinarily became servants, only as a temporary expedient
               to relieve themselves from embarrassment, and ceased to be
               such when that object was effected. The poverty that forced them to
               it was a calamity, and their service was either a means of relief, or a
               measure of prevention; not pursued as a permanent business, but resorted
               to on emergencies&#8212;a sort of episode in the main scope of their
               lives. Whereas with the Stranger, it was a
               <i>permanent employment</i>,
               pursued both as a <em>means</em> of bettering their own condition, and
               that of their posterity, and as an <em>end</em> for its own sake,
               conferring on them privileges, and a social estimation not otherwise
               attainable.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN47"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN47">A</a>: Another reason for protracting the service until
               the seventh year, seems to have been the coincidence of that period with other
               arrangements, in the Jewish economy. Its pecuniary responsibilities, social
               relations, and general internal structure, were <em>graduated</em> upon a
               septennial scale. Besides, as those Israelites who had become servants through
               poverty, would not sell themselves, till other expedients to recruit their
               finances had failed&#8212;(Lev. xxv. 35)&#8212;their <em>becoming
                  servants</em> proclaimed such a state of their affairs, as demanded the
               labor of a <em>course of years</em> fully to reinstate them.

               prefer a long term of service that those have who cannot own land, to prefer
               a long <em>lease</em>.

               We see from the foregoing, why servants purchased from the
               heathen, are called by way of distinction, <em>the</em> servants, (not
               <i>bondmen</i>,) 1. They followed it as a
               <i>permanent business</i>. 2. Their term of service was
               <em>much longer</em> than that of the other class. 3. As a
               class, they doubtless greatly outnumbered the Israelitish servants. 4. All
               the Strangers that dwelt in the land were
               <i>tributaries</i>, required to pay an annual
               tax to the government, either in money, or in public service,
               (called a <i>"tribute of bond-service;"</i>) in other
               words, all the Strangers were <i>national servants</i>,
               to the Israelites, and the same Hebrew word used to designate
               <i>individual</i> servants, equally designates
               <i>national</i> servants
               or tributaries. 2 Sam. viii. 2, 6, 14; 2 Chron. viii. 7-9;
               Deut, xx. 11; 2 Sam. x. 19; 1 Kings ix. 21, 22; 1 Kings iv. 21;
               Gen. xxvii. 29. The same word is applied to the Israelites, when they

               paid tribute to other nations. 2 Kings xvii. 3.; Judg. iii. 8, 14; Gen.
               xlix. 15. <a name="E4r4_Lev25_39_dsrv"></a>Another distinction between the
               Jewish and Gentile bought
               servants, was in their <em>kinds</em> of service. The servants from the
               Strangers were properly the <i>domestics</i>, or household
               servants, employed in all family work, in offices of personal attendance, and
               in such mechanical labor, as was required by increasing wants and needed
               repairs. The Jewish bought servants seem almost exclusively
               <i>agricultural</i>. Besides
               being better fitted for it by previous habits, agriculture, and the tending
               of cattle, were regarded by the Israelites as the most honorable of
               all occupations. After Saul was elected king, and escorted to Gibeah,
               the next report of him is, "<em>And behold Saul came after the herd out of
                  the field</em>." 1 Sam. xi. 5. Elisha "was plowing with twelve yoke of
               oxen." 1 Kings xix. 19. King Uzziah "loved husbandry." 2 Chron.
               xxvi. 10. Gideon <em>was "threshing wheat"</em> when called to lead the
               host against the Midianites. Judg. vi. 11. The superior honorableness
               of agriculture is shown, in that it was protected and supported by the
               fundamental law of the theocracy&#8212;God indicating it as the chief prop
               of the government. The Israelites were like permanent fixtures on
               their soil, so did they cling to it. To be agriculturists on their own
               patrimonial inheritances, was with them the grand claim to honorable
               estimation. When Ahab proposed to Naboth that he should sell him
               his vineyard, king though he was, he might well have anticipated from
               an Israelitish freeholder, just such an indignant burst as that which his
               proposal drew forth, "And Naboth said to Ahab, the Lord forbid it me
               that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee." 1 Kings
               xxi. 2, 3. Agriculture being pre-eminently a <i>Jewish</i>
               employment, to assign a native Israelite to other employments as a business,
               was to break up his habits, do violence to cherished predilections, and put
               him to a kind of labor in which he had no skill, and which he deemed
               degrading.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN49"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN49"></a> In short, it was in the earlier ages of the Mosaic system,
               practically to <i>unjew</i> him, a hardship and a rigor
               grievous to be borne, as it annihilated a visible distinction between the
               descendants of Abraham and the Strangers. <em>To guard this and another
                  fundamental distinction</em>, God instituted the regulation, "If thy brother
               that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee, thou shalt not
               compel him to serve as a bond-servant." In other words, thou shalt not put
               him to

               servant's work&#8212;to the business, and into the condition of domestics.
               In the Persian version it is translated, "Thou shalt not assign
               to him the work of <i>servitude</i>." In the Septuagint,
               "He shall not serve thee with the service of a
               <i>domestic</i>." In the Syriac, "Thou shalt not employ
               him after the manner of servants." In the Samaritan, "Thou shalt not
               require him to serve in the service of a servant." In the Targum of Onkelos,
               "He shall not serve thee with the service of a household servant." In the
               Targum of Jonathan, "Thou shalt not cause him to serve according to the usages
               of the servitude of servants."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN50"><sup>D</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN50"></a> The
               meaning of the passage is, <em>thou shalt not assign him to the same grade,
                  nor put him to the same service, with permanent domestics.</em> The
               remainder of the regulation is&#8212;<em>"But as an hired servant and as a
                  sojourner shall he be with thee."</em> Hired servants were not incorporated
               into the families of their masters; they still retained their own family
               organization, without the surrender of any domestic privilege, honor, or
               authority; and this, even though they resided under the same roof with their
               master. The same substantially may be said of the sojourner though he was not
               the owner of the land which he cultivated, and of course had not the
               control of an inheritance, yet he was not in a condition that implied
               subjection to him whose land he tilled, or that demanded the surrender of
               any <em>right</em>, or exacted from him any homage, or stamped him with
               any inferiority; unless, it be supposed that a degree of inferiority would
               naturally attach to a state of <em>dependence</em> however
               qualified. While bought servants were associated with their master's families
               at meals, at the Passover, and at other family festivals, hired servants
               and sojourners were not. Ex. xii. 44, 45; Lev. xxii. 10, 11. Hired
               servants were not subject to the authority of their masters in any such
               sense as the master's wife, children, and bought servants. Hence
               the only form of oppressing hired servants spoken of in the Scriptures
               as practicable to masters, is that of <em>keeping back their wages.</em>
               To have taken away such privileges in the case under consideration,
               would have been pre-eminent "<em>rigor</em>;" for it was not a servant
               born in

               the house of a master, nor a minor, whose minority had been sold by
               the father, neither was it one who had not yet acceded to his inheritance,
               nor finally, one who had received the <i>assignment</i>
               of his inheritance, but was working off from it an incumbrance, before
               entering upon its possession and control. But it was that of
               <em>the head of a family</em>, who had known better days, now reduced to
               poverty, forced to relinquish the loved inheritance of his fathers, with the
               competence and respectful consideration its possession secured to him, and
               to be indebted to a neighbor for shelter, sustenance, and employment.
               So sad a reverse, might well claim sympathy; but one consolation
               cheers him in the house of his pilgrimage; he is an
               <em>Israelite&#8212;Abraham is his father</em> and now in his calamity
               he clings closer than ever, to the distinction conferred by his birth-right.
               To rob him of this, were "the unkindest cut of all." To have assigned him to
               a grade of service filled only by those whose permanent business was serving,
               would have been to "rule over him with" peculiar "rigor." "Thou
               shalt not compel him to serve as a bond-servant," or literally, <em>thou
                  shalt not serve thyself with him, with the service of a servant</em>,
               guaranties his political privileges, and a kind and grade of service
               comporting with his character and relations as an Israelite. And "as a
               <i>hired</i> servant, and as a sojourner shall he be with
               thee," secures to him his family organization, the respect and authority due
               to its head, and the general consideration resulting from such a station.
               Being already in possession of his inheritance, and the head of a household,
               the law so arranged the conditions of his service as to <em>alleviate</em>
               as much as possible the calamity which had reduced him from independence and
               authority, to penury and subjection. The import of the command
               which concludes this topic in the forty-third verse, ("Thou shalt not
               rule over him with rigor,") is manifestly this, you shall not disregard
               those differences in previous associations, station, authority, and
               political privileges, upon which this regulation is based; for to hold
               this class of servants <em>irrespective</em> of these distinctions, and
               annihilating them, is to "rule with rigor." The same command is repeated in
               the forty-sixth verse, and applied to the distinction between servants of
               Jewish, and those of Gentile extraction, and forbids the overlooking
               of distinctive Jewish peculiarities, the disregard of which would be
               <em>rigorous</em> in the extreme.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN51"><sup>E</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN51"></a> The construction commonly put upon the

               phrase "rule with rigor," and the inference drawn from it, have an air
               vastly oracular. It is interpreted to mean, "you shall not make him
               a chattel, and strip him of legal protection, nor force him to work
               without pay." The inference is like unto it, viz., since the command
               forbade such outrages upon the Israelites, it permitted and commissioned
               their infliction upon the Strangers. Such impious and
               shallow smattering captivates scoffers and libertines; its flippancy and
               blasphemy, and the strong scent of its loose-reined license works
               like a charm upon them. What boots it to reason against such rampant
               affinities! In Ex. i. 13, it is said that the Egyptians, "made the
               children of Israel to <em>serve</em> with rigor." This rigor is affirmed
               of the <em>amount of labor</em> extorted and the <em>mode</em> of the
               exaction. The expression "serve with rigor," is never applied to the service
               of servants under the Mosaic system. The phrase, "thou shall not RULE over
               him with rigor," does not prohibit unreasonable exactions of labor,
               nor inflictions of cruelty. Such were provided against otherwise.
               But it forbids confounding the distinctions between a Jew and a
               Stranger, by assigning the former to the same grade of service,
               for the same term of time and under the same political disabilities as
               the latter.

               employments. Afterward their cities enlarged apace and trades

         <h2><a name="E4r4_review"></a></h2>
         <p>
            We are now prepared to review at a glance, the condition of the different
            classes of servants, with the modifications peculiar to each.

         </p>
         <p>
            In the possession of all fundamental rights, all classes of servants
            were on an absolute equality, all were equally protected by law in
            their persons, character, property and social relations; all were
            voluntary, all were compensated for their labor, and released from it
            nearly one half of the days in each year; all were furnished with
            stated instruction; none in either class were in any sense articles of
            property, all were regarded as <em>men</em>, with the rights, interests,
            hopes and destinies of <em>men</em>. In all these respects,
            <em>all</em> classes of servants among the Israelites, formed but ONE
            CLASS. The <em>different</em> classes, and the differences in
            <em>each</em> class, were, 1. <i>Hired Servants</i>.
            This class consisted both of Israelites and Strangers. Their employments were
            different. The <i>Israelite</i> was an agricultural
            servant. The Stranger was a <i>domestic</i> and
            <i>personal</i> servant, and in some instances
            <i>mechanical</i>; both were occasional and temporary.
            Both lived in their own families, their wages were
            <i>money</i>, and they were paid when their work
            was done. 2. <i>Bought Servants</i>, (including those
            "born in the house.") This class also, consisted of Israelites and Strangers,
            the same difference in their kinds of employment as noticed before. Both were

            paid in advance,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN52"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN52"></a> and
            neither was temporary. The Israelitish servant, with the exception of the
            <i>freeholder</i>, completed his term in six years.
            The Stranger was a permanent servant, continuing until the jubilee.
            A marked distinction obtained also between different classes of
            <i>Jewish</i> bought servants. Ordinarily, they were
            merged in their master's family, and, like his wife and children, subject to
            his authority; (and, like them, protected by law from its abuse.) But the
            <i>freeholder</i> was an exception; his family relations
            and authority remained unaffected, nor was he subjected as an inferior to the
            control of his master, though dependent on him for employment.

         </p>
         <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN52"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN52">A</a>: The payment <em>in
               advance</em>, doubtless lessened the price of the purchase; the
            servant thus having the use of the money, and the master assuming all the
            risks of life, and health for labor; at the expiration of the six years'
            contract, the master having suffered no loss from the risk incurred at the
            making of it, was obliged by law to release the servant with a liberal
            gratuity. The reason assigned for this is, "he hath been worth a double hired
            servant unto thee in serving thee six years," as if it had been said, as you
            have experienced no loss from the risks of life, and ability to labor,
            incurred in the purchase, and which lessened the price, and as, by being your
            servant for six years, he has saved you the time and trouble of looking up and
            hiring laborers on emergencies, therefore, "thou shalt furnish him liberally,"
            &amp;c.

         </p>
         <p>
            This gratuity at the close of the service shews the
            <i>principle</i> of the relation;
            <i>equivalent</i> for value received.
         </p>
         <p>
            It should be kept in mind, that <em>both</em> classes of servants, the
            Israelite and the Stranger, not only enjoyed <em>equal, natural and
               religious rights</em>, but <em>all the civil and political
               privileges</em> enjoyed by those of their own people who were
            <em>not</em> servants. <a name="E4r4_review_pol"></a>They also shared in
            common with them the political disabilities which appertained to all
            Strangers, whether servants of Jewish masters, or masters of Jewish servants.
            Further, the disabilities of the servants from the Strangers were exclusively
            <i>political</i> and <i>national</i>.
            1. They, in common with all Strangers, could not own the soil. 2. They were
            ineligible to civil offices. 3. They were assigned to employments less
            honorable than those in which Israelitish servants engaged; agriculture being
            regarded as fundamental to the existence of the state, other employments were
            in less repute, and deemed <i>unjewish</i>.

         </p>
         <p>
            Finally, the Strangers, whether servants or masters, were all protected
            equally with the descendants of Abraham. In respect to political
            privileges, their condition was much like that of unnaturalized
            foreigners in the United States; whatever their wealth or intelligence,
            or moral principle, or love for our institutions, they can neither go to

            the ballot-box, nor own the soil, nor be eligible to office. Let a native
            American, be suddenly bereft of these privileges, and loaded with the
            disabilities of an alien, and what to the foreigner would be a light matter,
            to <em>him</em>, would be the severity of <em>rigor</em>. The recent
            condition of the Jews and Catholics in England, is another illustration.
            Rothschild, the late banker, though the richest private citizen in the world,
            and perhaps master of scores of English servants, who sued for the
            smallest crumbs of his favor, was, as a subject of the government, inferior
            to the lowest among them. Suppose an Englishman of the
            Established Church, were by law deprived of power to own the soil,
            of eligibility to office and of the electoral franchise, would Englishmen
            think it a misapplication of language, if it were said, the government
            "rules over him with rigor?" And yet his person, property, reputation,
            conscience, all his social relations, the disposal of his time, the
            right of locomotion at pleasure, and of natural liberty in all respects,
            are just as much protected by law as the Lord Chancellor's.

               FINALLY.&#8212;As the Mosaic system was a great compound type, rife
               with meaning in doctrine and duty; the practical power of the whole,
               depended upon the exact observance of those distinctions and relations
               which constituted its significancy. Hence, the care to preserve inviolate
               the distinction between a <i>descendant of Abraham</i>
               and a <i>Stranger</i>, even when the Stranger was a
               proselyte, had gone through the initiatory ordinances, entered the
               congregation, and become incorporated with the Israelites by family alliance.
               The regulation laid down in Ex. xxi. 2-6, is an illustration. In this case,
               the Israelitish servant, whose term expired in six years, married one of his
               master's <i>permanent female domestics</i>; but her
               marriage did not release her master from <em>his</em> part of the contract
               for her whole term of service, nor from his legal obligation to support and
               educate her children. Neither did it do away that distinction, which marked
               her national descent by a specific <i>grade</i> and
               <i>term</i> of service, nor impair her obligation to
               fulfil <em>her</em> part of the contract. Her relations as a permanent
               domestic grew out of a distinction guarded with great care throughout the
               Mosaic system. To render it void, would have been to divide the system against
               itself. This God would not tolerate. Nor, on the other hand, would
               he permit the master to throw off the responsibility of instructing her
               children, nor the care and expense of their helpless infancy and rearing.
               He was bound to support and educate them, and all her children
               born afterwards during her term of service. The whole arrangement
               beautifully illustrates that wise and tender regard for the interests of
               all the parties concerned, which arrays the Mosaic system in robes of

               glory, and causes it to shine as the sun in the kingdom of our
               Father.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN53"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN53"></a> By this law, the children had secured to them a mother's
               tender care. If the husband loved his wife and children, he could compel his
               master to keep him, whether he had any occasion for his services or not. If
               he did not love them, to be rid of him was a blessing; and in that case,
               the regulation would prove an act for the relief of an afflicted family.
               It is not by any means to be inferred, that the release of the servant
               in the seventh year, either absolved him from the obligations of marriage,
               or shut him out from the society of his family. He could doubtless
               procure a service at no great distance from them, and might often
               do it, to get higher wages, or a kind of employment better suited to his
               taste and skill. The great number of days on which the law released
               servants from regular labor, would enable him to spend much more
               time with his family, than can be spent by most of the agents of our
               benevolent societies with <em>their</em> families, or by many merchants,
               editors, artists, &amp;c., whose daily business is in New York, while their
               families reside from ten to one hundred miles in the country.

               We conclude this inquiry by touching upon an objection, which,
               though not formally stated, has been already set aside by the tenor of
               the foregoing argument. It is this,&#8212;"The slavery of the Canaanites
               by the Israelites, was appointed by God as a commutation of the
               punishment of death denounced against them for their
               sins."<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN54"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN54"></a> If the
               absurdity of a sentence consigning persons to death, and at the same
               time to perpetual slavery, did not sufficiently laugh at itself; it would
               be small self-denial, in a case so tempting, to make up the deficiency by
               a general contribution. Only <em>one</em> statute was ever given
               respecting the disposition to be made of the inhabitants of Canaan. If the
               sentence of death was pronounced against them, and afterwards
               <i>commuted</i>, when? where? by whom? and in what terms
               was the commutation,

               and where is it recorded? Grant, for argument's sake, that all the
               Canaanites were sentenced to unconditional extermination; how can a
               right to <em>enslave</em> them, be drawn from such premises? The
               punishment of death is one of the highest recognitions of man's moral nature
               possible. It proclaims him rational, accountable, guilty, deserving death
               for having done his utmost to cheapen human life, when the proof of
               its priceless worth lived in his own nature. But to make him a
               <i>slave</i>, cheapens to nothing
               <i>universal human nature</i>, and instead of healing a
               wound, gives a death-stab. What! repair an injury to rational being
               in the robbery of one of its rights, not only by robbing it of all, but
               by annihilating their <i>foundation</i>, the everlasting
               distinction between persons and things? To make a man a chattel, is not the
               <em>punishment</em>, but the <em>annihilation</em> of a
               <i>human</i> being, and, so far as it goes, of
               <em>all</em> human beings. This commutation of the punishment of death,
               into perpetual slavery, what a fortunate discovery! Alas! for the honor
               of Deity, if commentators had not manned the forlorn hope, and by a
               timely movement rescued the Divine character, at the very crisis of its
               fate, from the perilous position in which inspiration had carelessly left
               it! Here a question arises of sufficient importance for a separate
               dissertation; but must for the present be disposed of in a few paragraphs.
               WERE THE CANAANITES SENTENCED BY GOD TO INDIVIDUAL
               AND UNCONDITIONAL EXTERMINATION? As the limits of this inquiry
               forbid our giving all the grounds of dissent from commonly received
               opinions, the suggestions made, will be thrown out merely as QUERIES,
               rather than laid down as <i>doctrines</i>. The directions
               as to the disposal of the Canaanites, are mainly in the following passages,
               Ex. xxiii. 23-33; xxxiv. 11; Deut. vii. 16-24; ix. 3; xxxi. 3-5. In these
               verses, the Israelites are commanded to "destroy the Canaanites," to
               "drive out," "consume," "utterly overthrow," "put out," "dispossess
               them," &amp;c. Did these commands enjoin the unconditional and universal
               destruction of the <em>individuals</em>, or merely of the
               <i>body politic</i>? The word
               <i>h&#257;r&#257;m</i>, to destroy,
               signifies <i>national</i>, as well as individual
               destruction; the destruction of <i>political</i>
               existence, equally with <i>personal</i>;
               of governmental organization, equally with the lives of the subjects.
               Besides, if we interpret the words destroy, consume, overthrow, &amp;c.,
               to mean <i>personal</i> destruction, what meaning shall we
               give to the expressions, "drive out before thee," "cast out before thee,"
               "expel," "put out," "dispossess," &amp;c., which are used in the same and in
               parallel passages? In addition to those quoted above, see Josh. iii. 10;
               xvii. 18; xxiii. 5; xxiv. 18; Judg. i. 20, 29-35; vi. 9. "I will
               <em>destroy</em> all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make
               all

               thine enemies <em>turn their backs unto thee</em>." Ex. xxiii. 27. Here
               "<em>all their enemies</em>" were to <em>turn their backs</em>, and
               "<em>all the people</em>" to be "<em>destroyed</em>." Does this mean
               that God would let all their <em>enemies</em> escape, but kill their
               <em>friends</em>, or that he would <em>first</em> kill "all the
               people" and THEN make them "turn their backs," an army of runaway corpses?
               In Josh. xxiv. 8, God says, speaking of the Amorites, "I
               <em>destroyed</em> them from before you." In the 18th verse of the same
               chapter, it is said, "The Lord <em>drave out</em> from before us all the
               people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land." In Num. xxxii. 39, we are
               told that "the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, went to Gilead, and
               took it, and <em>dispossessed</em> the Amorite which was in it." If these
               commands required the destruction of all the
               <i>individuals,</i> the Mosaic law
               was at war with itself, for directions as to the treatment of native residents
               form a large part of it. See Lev. xix. 34; xxv. 35, 36; xxiv. 22.;
               Ex. xxiii. 9; xxii. 21; Deut. i. 16, 17; x. 17, 19; xxvii. 19.
               We find, also, that provision was made for them in the cities of refuge,
               Num. xxxv. 15,&#8212;the gleanings of the harvest and vintage were theirs,
               Lev. xix. 9, 10; xxiii. 22;&#8212;the blessings of the Sabbath, Ex. xx.
               10;&#8212;the privilege of offering sacrifices secured, Lev. xxii. 18; and
               stated religious instruction provided for them. Deut. xxxi. 9, 12.
               Now does this same law require the
               <i>individual extermination</i> of those
               whose lives and interests it thus protects? These laws were given to
               the Israelites, long <em>before</em> they entered Canaan; and they must
               have inferred from them, that a multitude of the inhabitants of the land were
               to <em>continue in it</em>, under their government. Again Joshua was
               selected as the leader of Israel to execute God's threatenings upon Canaan.
               He had no discretionary power. God's commands were his official
               instructions. Going beyond them would have been usurpation; refusing
               to carry them out, rebellion and treason. Saul was rejected from
               being king for disobeying God's commands in a single instance. Now if
               God commanded the individual destruction of all the Canaanites Joshua
               disobeyed him in every instance. For at his death, the Israelites still
               "<em>dwelt among them</em>," and each nation is mentioned by name. Judg.
               i. 27-36, and yet we are told that Joshua "left nothing undone of all
               that the Lord commanded Moses;" and that he "took all that land."
               Josh. xi. 15-22. Also, that "there <em>stood not a man</em> of
               <em>all</em> their enemies
               before them." Josh. xxi. 44. How can this be if the command
               to destroy, destroy utterly, &amp;c., enjoined
               <i>individual</i> extermination, and
               the command to drive out, unconditional expulsion from the country, rather
               than their expulsion from the <i>possession</i> or
               <i>ownership</i> of it, as the
               lords of the soil? That the latter is the true sense to be attached to those

               terms, we argue, further from the fact that the same terms are employed
               by God to describe the punishment which he would inflict upon
               the Israelites if they served other Gods. "Ye shall utterly perish,"
               "be utterly destroyed," "consumed," &amp;c., are some of them.&#8212;See
               Deut. iv. 20; viii. 19, 20.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN55"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN55"></a> Josh. xxiii. 12, 13-16; 1. Sam. xii.
               25. The Israelites <em>did</em> serve other Gods, and Jehovah
               <em>did</em> execute upon them his threatenings&#8212;and thus himself
               <em>interpreted</em> these threatenings. He subverted their
               <em>government</em>, dispossessed them of their land, divested them of
               national power, and made them <i>tributaries</i>, but
               did not <em>exterminate</em> them. He "destroyed them utterly" as an
               independent body politic, but not as individuals. Multitudes of the
               Canaanites were slain, but not a case can be found in which one was
               either killed or expelled who <em>acquiesced</em> in the transfer of the
               territory, and its sovereignty, from the inhabitants of the land to the
               Israelites. Witness the case of Rahab and her kindred, and that of the
               Gibeonites.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN56"><sup>C</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN56"></a> The Canaanites knew of the miracles wrought for the

               Israelites; and that their land had been transferred to them as a
               judgment for their sins. Josh. ii. 9-11; ix. 9, 10, 24. Many of
               them were awed by these wonders, and made no resistance. Others
               defied God and came out to battle. These last occupied the fortified
               cities, were the most inveterate heathen&#8212;the aristocracy of idolatry,
               the kings, the nobility and gentry, the priests, with their crowds of
               satellites, and retainers that aided in idolatrous rites, and the military
               forces, with the chief profligates of both sexes. Many facts corroborate
               the general position. Witness that command (Deut. xxiii. 15, 16,)
               which, not only prohibited the surrender of the fugitive servant to his
               master, but required the Israelites to receive him with kindness, permit
               him to dwell where he pleased, and to protect and cherish him.
               Whenever any servant, even a Canaanite, fled from his master to the
               Israelites, Jehovah, so far from commanding them to <em>kill</em> him,
               straitly charged them, "He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that
               place which <em>he</em> shall choose&#8212;in one of thy gates where it
               liketh <em>him</em> best&#8212;thou shalt not oppress him."
               Deut. xxiii. 16. The Canaanitish servant by thus fleeing to the Israelites,
               submitted himself as a dutiful subject to their national government, and
               pledged his allegiance. Suppose <em>all</em> the Canaanites had thus
               submitted themselves to the Jewish theocracy, and conformed to the
               requirements of the Mosaic institutes, would not <em>all</em> have been
               spared upon the same principle that <em>one</em> was? Again, look at the
               multitude of <i>tributaries</i> in the midst of Israel,
               and that too, after they had "waxed strong," and the uttermost nations
               quaked at the terror of their name&#8212;the Canaanites, Philistines and
               others, who became proselytes&#8212;as the Nethenims, Uriah the
               Hittite&#8212;Rahab, who married one of the princes of Judah&#8212;Jether, an

               Temple.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN57"><sup>D</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN57"></a> Besides, the greatest miracle on record, was wrought to
               save a portion of those very Canaanites, and for the destruction of those
               who would exterminate them. Josh. x. 12-14. Further&#8212;the terms
               employed in the directions regulating the disposal of the Canaanites, such
               as "drive out," "put out," "cast out," "expel," "dispossess," &amp;c., seem
               used interchangeably with "consume," "destroy," "overthrow," &amp;c., and
               thus indicate the sense in which the latter words are used. As an illustration
               of the meaning generally attached to these and similar
               terms, we refer to the history of the Amalekites. "I will utterly put
               out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven." Ex. xvii. 14.
               "Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven;
               thou shalt not forget it." Deut. xxv. 19. "Smite Amalek and
               <em>utterly destroy</em> all that they have, and spare them not, but slay
               both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep." 1 Sam. xv. 2,
               3. "Saul smote the Amalekites, and he took Agag the king of the
               Amalekites, alive and UTTERLY DESTROYED ALL THE PEOPLE with
               the edge of the sword." Verses 7, 8. In verse 20, Saul says, "I
               have brought Agag, the king of Amalek, and have <em>utterly destroyed</em>
               the Amalekites." In 1 Sam. xxx. 1, 2, we find the Amalekites marching
               an army into Israel, and sweeping everything before them&#8212;and this
               in about eighteen years after they had all been "UTTERLY DESTROYED!"
               In 1 Kings ii. 15-17, is another illustration. We are informed
               that Joab remained in Edom six months with all Israel, "until he had
               <em>cut off every male</em>" in Edom. In the next verse we learn that
               Hadad and "certain Edomites" were not slain. Deut. xx. 16, 17, will probably
               be quoted against the preceding view. We argue that the command
               in these verses, did not include all the individuals of the Canaanitish
               nations, but only the inhabitants of the <em>cities</em>, (and even those
               conditionally,) because, only the inhabitants of <em>cities</em> are
               specified&#8212;"of the <em>cities</em> of these people thou shalt save
               alive nothing that breatheth." Cities then, as now, were pest-houses of vice,
               they reeked with abominations little practised in the country. On this
               account, their influence

               would be far more perilous to the Israelites than that of the country.
               Besides, they were the centres of idolatry&#8212;there were the temples and
               altars, and idols, and priests, without number. Even their buildings,
               streets, and public walks were so many visibilities of idolatry. The
               reason assigned in the 18th verse for exterminating them, strengthens
               the idea&#8212;"that they teach you not to do after all the abominations which
               they have done unto their gods." This would be a reason for exterminating
               all the nations and individuals <em>around</em> them,
               as all were idolaters; but God commanded them, in certain cases, to
               spare the inhabitants. Contact with <em>any</em> of them
               would be perilous&#8212;with the inhabitants of the <em>cities</em>
               peculiarly, and of the <i>Canaanitish</i> cities
               pre-eminently so. The 10th and 11th verses contain the general rule
               prescribing the method in which cities were to be summoned to surrender.
               They were first to receive the offer of peace&#8212;if it was accepted,
               the inhabitants became <i>tributaries</i>&#8212;but if
               they came out against Israel in battle, the <em>men</em> were
               to be killed, and the woman and little ones saved alive. The 15th verse
               restricts this lenient treatment to the inhabitants of the cities
               <em>afar off</em>. The 16th directs as to the disposal
               of the inhabitants of the Canaanitish cities. They were to save alive
               "nothing that breathed." The common mistake has been, in supposing
               that the command in the 15th verse refers to the
               <em>whole system of directions preceding,</em>
               commencing with the 10th, whereas it manifestly refers only to the
               <em>inflictions</em> specified in
               the 12th, 13th, and, 14th, making a distinction between those
               <i>Canaanitish</i> cities that
               <em>fought</em>, and the cities
               <em>afar off</em> that fought&#8212;in one case destroying
               the males and females, and in the other, the
               <em>males</em> only. The offer of peace, and the
               <i>conditional preservation</i>, were as really
               guarantied to <i>Canaanitish</i> cities as to others.
               Their inhabitants were not to be exterminated unless they came out against
               Israel in battle. Whatever be the import of the commands respecting the
               disposition to be made of the Canaanites, all admit the fact that the
               Israelites did <em>not</em> utterly exterminate them.
               Now, if entire and unconditional extermination
               was the command of God, it was <em>never</em> obeyed by the
               Israelites, consequently the truth of God stood pledged to consign
               <em>them</em> to the same doom which he had pronounced
               upon the Canaanites, but which they had refused to visit upon them. "If ye
               will not drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it
               shall come to pass that * * <em>I shall do unto you as I
                  thought to do unto them</em>." Num. xxxiii. 55,
               56. As the Israelites were not exterminated, we infer that God did not
               pronounce <em>that</em> doom upon them; and as he <em>did</em>
               pronounce upon them the <em>same</em> doom, whatever it was, which they
               should <em>refuse</em> to

               visit upon the Canaanites, it follows that the doom of unconditional
               <i>extermination</i> was <em>not</em> pronounced
               against the Canaanites. But let us settle this question by the "law and the
               testimony." "There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel
               save the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon; all others they took in battle.
               For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, that they should COME OUT
               AGAINST ISRAEL IN BATTLE, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they
               might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as the Lord commanded
               Moses." Josh. xi. 19. 20. That is, if they had <em>not</em> come out
               against Israel in battle, they would have had "favor" shown them, and would
               not have been "<i>destroyed utterly</i>." The great design
               was to <i>transfer the territory</i> of the Canaanites to
               the Israelites, and along with it, <i>absolute sovereignty in
                  every respect</i>; to annihilate their political organizations, civil
               polity, and jurisprudence, and their system of religion, with all its rights
               and appendages; and to substitute therefor, a pure theocracy, administered by
               Jehovah, with the Israelites as His representatives and agents. In a word
               the people were to be <i>denationalized,</i> their
               political existence annihilated, their idol temples, altars, groves, images,
               pictures, and heathen rites destroyed, and themselves put under tribute.
               Those who resisted the execution of Jehovah's purpose were to be killed,
               while those who quietly submitted to it were to be spared. All had the
               choice of these alternatives, either free egress out of the
               land;<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r4_FN58"><sup>E</sup></a><a name="FootE4r4_FN58"></a> or acquiescence in the
               decree, with life and residence as tributaries, under the protection of the
               government; or resistance to the execution of the decree, with death.
               "<em>And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of
                  my people, to swear by my name, the Lord liveth, as they taught my people to
                  swear by Baal;</em> THEN SHALL THEY BE BUILT IN THE MIDST OF MY PEOPLE."

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN54"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN54">A</a>: In the prophecy, Gen. ix. 25, the subjection
               of the Canaanites as a conquered people rendering tribute to other nations,
               is foretold by inspiration. The fulfilment of this prediction, seems to have
               commenced in the subjection of the Canaanites to the Israelites as
               tributaries. If the Israelites had exterminated them, as the objector asserts
               they were commanded to do; the prediction would have been
               <em>falsified</em>.
            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN55"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN55">B</a>: These two verses are so
               explicit we quote them entire&#8212;"And it shall be if thou do at all forget
               the Lord they God and walk after other Gods and serve them, and worship them,
               I testify against you this day that ye shall surely <em>perish</em>, as
               the nations which the Lord destroyed before your face, <em>so</em> shall
               ye perish." The following passages are, if possible still more
               explicit&#8212;"The Lord shall send upon thee cursing, vexation and rebuke in
               all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be
               <em>destroyed</em>, and until thou perish quickly." "The
               Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee until he have
               <em>consumed</em> thee." "They (the 'sword,' 'blasting,' &amp;c.) shall
               pursue thee until thou <em>perish</em>." "From heaven shall it come down
               upon thee until thou be <em>destroyed</em>." "All these curses shall come
               upon thee till thou be <em>destroyed</em>." "He shall put a yoke of
               iron upon thy neck until he have <em>destroyed</em> thee." "The Lord shall
               bring a nation against thee, a nation of fierce countenance, which shall not
               regard the person of the old, nor show favor to the young, * * until he have
               <em>destroyed</em> thee." All these, with other similar threatenings of
               <em>destruction</em>, are contained in the twenty-eighth chapter of Deut.
               See verses 20-25, 45, 48, 51. In the <em>same</em> chapter God declares
               that as a punishment for the same transgressions, the Israelites shall "be
               <em>removed</em> into all the kingdoms of the earth," thus showing
               that the terms employed in the other verses, "destroy," "perish," "perish
               quickly," "consume," &amp;c., instead of signifying utter, personal
               destruction doubtless meant their destruction as an independent nation. In
               Josh. xxiv. 8, 18, "destroyed" and "drave out," are used
               synonymously.
            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE4r4_FN56"></a><a href="#FootE4r4_FN56">C</a>: Perhaps it will be objected, that the
               preservation of the Gibeonites, and of Rahab and her kindred, was a violation
               of the command of God. We answer, if it had been, we might expect some such
               intimation. If God had straitly commanded them to <em>exterminate all the
                  Canaanites</em>, their pledge to save them alive, was neither a repeal of
               the statute, nor absolution for the breach of it. If
               <i>unconditional destruction</i> was the import of the
               command, would God have permitted such an act to pass without rebuke? Would he
               have established such a precedent when Israel had hardly passed the threshold
               of Canaan, and was then striking the first blow of a half century war? What
               if they <em>had</em> passed their word to Rahab and the Gibeonites? Was
               that more binding than God's command? So Saul seems to have passed
               <em>his</em> word to Agag; yet Samuel hewed him in pieces, because in
               saving his life, Saul had violated God's command. When Saul sought to slay the
               Gibeonites in "his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah," God sent upon
               Israel a three years' famine for it. When David inquired of them what
               atonement he should make, they say, "The man that devised against us, that we
               should be destroyed from <em>remaining in any of the coast of
                  Israel</em>, let seven of his sons be delivered," &amp;c.
               2 Sam. xxi. 1-6.

               unconditional extermination, to have employed them in the erection of the
               temple,&#8212;what was it but the climax of impiety? As well might they
               pollute its altars with swine's flesh or make their sons pass through the
               fire to Moloch.

               abandoned their territory at the tidings of Israel's approach, did God's
               command require the Israelites to chase them to ends of the earth, and hunt
               them out, until every Canaanite was destroyed? It is too preposterous for
               belief, and yet it follows legitimately from that construction, which
               interprets the terms "consume," "destroy," "destroy utterly," &amp;c. to
               mean unconditional, individual extermination.

            <p>
               A civilized community presupposes a government of law. If
               that government be a republic, its citizens are the sole <em>sources</em>,
               as well as the <em>subjects</em> of its power. Its constitution is their
               bill of directions to their own agents&#8212;a grant authorizing the exercise
               of certain powers, and prohibiting that of others. In the Constitution of the
               United States, whatever else may be obscure, the clause granting power to
               Congress over the Federal District may well defy misconstruction.
               Art. 1, Sec. 6, Clause 18: "The Congress shall have power to exercise
               exclusive legislation, <em>in all cases whatsoever</em>, over such
               District." Congress may make laws for the District "in all
               <em>cases</em>," not of all <em>kinds</em>; not all <em>laws</em>
               whatsoever, but laws "in all <em>cases</em> whatsoever."
               The grant respects the <em>subjects</em> of legislation, <em>not</em>
               the moral nature of the laws. The law-making power every where is subject to
               <em>moral</em> restrictions, whether limited by constitutions or not. No
               legislature can authorize murder, nor make honesty penal, nor virtue a crime,
               nor exact impossibilities. In these and similar respects, the power of
               Congress is held in check by principles, existing in the nature of
               things, not imposed by the Constitution, but presupposed and assumed
               by it. The power of Congress over the District is restricted only by
               those principles that limit ordinary legislation, and, in some respects,
               it has even wider scope.

            </p>
            <p>
               In common with the legislatures of the States, Congress cannot
               constitutionally pass ex post facto laws in criminal cases, nor suspend
               the writ of habeas corpus, nor pass a bill of attainder, nor abridge the
               freedom of speech and of the press, nor invade the right of the people
               to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, nor enact
               laws respecting an establishment of religion. These are general limitations.
               Congress cannot do these things <em>any where</em>. The exact
               import, therefore, of the clause "in all cases whatsoever," is, <em>on all
                  subjects within the appropriate sphere of legislation</em>. Some
               legislatures
               are restrained by constitutions, from the exercise of powers
               strictly within the proper sphere of legislation. Congressional power
               over the District has no such restraint. It traverses the whole field
               of legitimate legislation. All the power which any legislature has
               within its own jurisdiction, Congress holds over the District of Columbia.

            </p>
            <p>
               It has been objected that the clause in question respects merely

               police regulations, and that its sole design was to enable Congress to
               protect itself against popular tumults. But if the convention that
               framed the Constitution aimed to provide for a <em>single</em> case only,
               why did they provide for "<em>all</em> cases whatsoever?" Besides, this
               clause was opposed in many of the state conventions, because the grant of
               power was extended to "<em>all</em> cases whatsoever," instead of being
               restricted to police regulations <em>alone</em>. In the Virginia
               Convention, George Mason, the father of the Virginia Constitution, Patrick
               Henry, Mr. Grayson, and others, assailed it on that ground. Mr. Mason said,
               "This clause gives an unlimited authority in every possible case within
               the District. He would willingly give them exclusive power as far as
               respected the police and good government of the place, but he would
               give them no more." Mr. Grayson exclaimed against so large a
               grant of power&#8212;said that control over the <em>police</em> was
               all-sufficient, and "that the Continental Congress never had an idea of
               exclusive legislation in all cases." Patrick Henry said: "Shall we be told,
               when about to grant such illimitable authority, that it will never be
               exercised? Is it consistent with any principle of prudence or good
               policy, to grant <em>unlimited, unbounded authority</em>?" Mr. Madison
               said in reply: "I did conceive that the clause under consideration was one
               of those parts which would speak its own praise. I cannot comprehend
               that the power of legislation over a small District, will involve
               the dangers which he apprehends. When any power is given, it's delegation
               necessarily involves authority to make laws to execute it.
               * * * * The powers which are found necessary to be given, are
               therefore delegated <em>generally</em>, and particular and minute
               specification is left to the Legislature. * * * It is not within the limits of
               human capacity to delineate on paper all those particular cases and
               circumstances, in which legislation by the general legislature, would be
               necessary." Governor Randolph said: "Holland has no ten miles
               square, but she has the Hague where the deputies of the States assemble.
               But the influence which it has given the province of Holland, to
               have the seat of government within its territory, subject in some respects
               to its control, has been injurious to the other provinces. The
               wisdom of the convention is therefore manifest in granting to Congress
               exclusive jurisdiction over the place of their session."
               (<i>See debates in the Virginia Convention</i>, p. 320.) In
               the forty-third number of the "Federalist," Mr. Madison says: "The
               indispensable necessity of <em>complete</em> authority at the seat of
               government, carries its own evidence with it."

            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, that the grant in question is to be interpreted according to
               the obvious import of its <em>terms</em>, and not in such a way as to
               restrict it to <em>police</em> regulations, is proved by the fact, that
               the State of Virginia proposed an amendment to the United States Constitution
               at the time of its adoption, providing that this clause "should be so
               construed as to give power only over the <em>police and good
                  government</em> of said District," <em>which amendment was
                  rejected</em>. Fourteen other amendments, proposed at the same time by
               Virginia, were <em>adopted</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               The former part, of the clause under consideration, "Congress
               shall have power to exercise <em>exclusive</em> legislation," gives sole
               jurisdiction, and the latter part, "in all cases whatsoever," defines the
               <em>extent</em> of it. Since, then, Congress is the <em>sole</em>
               legislature within the District, and since its power is limited only by the
               checks common to all legislatures, it follows that what the law-making power
               is intrinsically competent to do <em>any</em> where, Congress is competent
               to do in the District of Columbia.

            <h3><a name="E5stat"></a>
               STATEMENT OF THE QUESTION AT ISSUE.

            </h3>
            <p>
               Having disposed of preliminaries, we proceed to argue the <em>real
                  question</em> at issue. Is the law-making power competent to abolish slavery
               when not restricted in that particular by constitutional provisions&#8212;or,
               <em>Is the abolition of slavery within the appropriate sphere of
                  legislation?</em></p>
            <p>
               In every government, absolute sovereignty exists <em>somewhere</em>. In
               the United States it exists primarily with the <em>people</em>, and
               <em>ultimate</em> sovereignty <em>always</em> exists with them.
               In each of the States, the legislature possesses a
               <i>representative</i> sovereignty, delegated by the people
               through the Constitution&#8212;the people thus committing to the legislature
               a portion of their sovereignty, and specifying in their constitutions the
               amount and the conditions of the grant. That the <em>people</em> in any
               state where slavery exists, have the power to abolish it, none will deny. If
               the legislature have not the power, it is because <em>the people</em> have
               reserved it to themselves. Had they lodged with the legislature "power
               to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever," they
               would have parted with their sovereignty over the legislation of the
               State, and so far forth the legislature would have become
               <em>the people</em>, clothed with all their functions, and as such
               competent, <em>during the continuance of the grant</em>, to do whatever
               the people might have done before the surrender of their power: consequently,
               they would have the power to abolish slavery. The sovereignty of the District
               of Columbia exists <em>somewhere</em>&#8212;where is it lodged? The
               citizens of the District have no legislature of their own, no representation
               in Congress, and no political power whatever. Maryland and Virginia have
               surrendered to the United States their "full and absolute right and entire
               sovereignty," and the people of the United States have committed to
               Congress by the Constitution, the power to "exercise exclusive legislation
               in all cases whatsoever over such District."

            </p>
            <p>
               Thus, the sovereignty of the District of Columbia, is shown to reside
               solely in the Congress of the United States; and since the power of the
               people of a state to abolish slavery within their own limits, results from
               their entire sovereignty within the state, so the power of Congress to
               abolish slavery in the District, results from its entire
               <em>sovereignty</em> within the District. If it be objected that Congress
               can have no more power over the District, than was held by the legislatures of
               Maryland and Virginia, we ask what clause in the constitution graduates the
               power of Congress by the standard of a state legislature? Was the United
               States constitution worked into its present shape under the measuring
               line and square of Virginia and Maryland? and is its power to be bevelled

               down till it can run in the grooves of state legislation? There is
               a deal of prating about constitutional power over the District, as though
               Congress were indebted for it to Maryland and Virginia. The powers
               of those states, whether few or many, prodigies or nullities, have nothing
               to do with the question. As well thrust in the powers of the Grand
               Lama to join issue upon, or twist papal bulls into constitutional tether,
               with which to curb congressional action. The Constitution of the
               United States gives power to Congress, and takes it away, and <em>it
                  alone</em>. Maryland and Virginia adopted the Constitution
               <em>before</em> they ceded to the united States the territory of the
               District. By their acts of cession, they abdicated their own sovereignty over
               the District, and thus made room for that provided by the United States
               constitution, which sovereignty was to commence as soon as a cession of
               territory by states, and its acceptance by Congress furnished a sphere for its
               exercise.

            </p>
            <p>
               That the abolition of slavery is within the sphere of legislation, I
               argue, <em>secondly</em>, from the fact, that <em>slavery as a legal
                  system, is the creature of legislation</em>. The law by
               <em>creating</em> slavery, not only affirmed its <em>existence</em>
               to be within the sphere and under the control of legislation, but equally,
               the <em>conditions</em> and <em>terms</em> of its existence, and the
               <em>question</em> whether or not it <em>should</em> exist. Of course
               legislation would not travel <em>out</em> of its sphere, in abolishing
               what is <em>within</em> it, and what was recognised
               to be within it, by its own act. Cannot legislatures repeal their
               own laws? If law can take from a man his rights, it can give them
               back again. If it can say, "your body belongs to your neighbor," it
               can say, "it belongs to <em>yourself</em>, and I will sustain your right."
               If it can annul a man's right to himself, held by express grant from his
               Maker, and can create for another an artificial title to him, can it not annul
               the artificial title, and leave the original owner to hold himself by his
               original title?

            </p>
            <p>
               3. <em>The abolition of slavery has always been considered within the
                  appropriate sphere of legislation</em>. Almost every civilized nation has
               abolished slavery by law. The history of legislation since the revival of
               letters, is a record crowded with testimony to the universally admitted
               competency of the law-making power to abolish slavery. It is so
               manifestly an attribute not merely of absolute sovereignty, but even
               of ordinary legislation, that the competency of a legislature to exercise
               it, may well nigh be reckoned among the legal axioms of the civilized
               world. Even the night of the dark ages was not dark enough
               to make this invisible.

            </p>
            <p>
               The Abolition decree of the great council of England was passed
               in 1102. The memorable Irish decree, "that all the English slaves
               in the whole of Ireland, be immediately emancipated and restored to
               their former liberty," was issued in 1171. Slavery in England was
               abolished by a general charter of emancipation in 1381. Passing
               over many instances of the abolition of slavery by law, both during
               the middle ages and since the reformation, we find them multiplying
               as we approach our own times. In 1776 slavery was abolished in
               Prussia by special edict. In St. Domingo, Cayenne, Guadaloupe

               and Martinique, in 1794, where more than 600,000 slaves were
               emancipated by the French government. In Java, 1811; in Ceylon,
               1815; in Buenos Ayres, 1816; in St. Helena, 1819; in Colombia,
               1821; by the Congress of Chili in 1821; in Cape Colony, 1823;
               in Malacca, 1825; in the southern provinces of Birmah, in 1826; in
               Bolivia, 1826; in Peru, Guatemala, and Monte Video, 1828, in Jamaica,
               Barbadoes, Bermudas, Bahamas, the Mauritius, St. Christopher's,
               Nevis, the Virgin Islands, Antigua, Montserrat, Dominica, St.
               Vincents, Grenada, Berbice, Tobago, St. Lucia, Trinidad, Honduras,
               Demarara, and the Cape of Good Hope, on the 1st of August, 1834.
               But waving details, suffice it to say, that England, France, Spain,
               Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Prussia, and Germany, have all
               and often given their testimony to the competency of the law to
               abolish slavery. In our own country, the Legislature of Pennsylvania
               passed an act of abolition in 1780, Connecticut, in 1784; Rhode Island,
               1784; New-York, 1799; New-Jersey, in 1804; Vermont, by Constitution,
               in 1777; Massachusetts, in 1780; and New Hampshire, in
               1784.

            </p>
            <p>
               When the competency of the law-making power to abolish slavery,
               has thus been recognised every where and for ages, when it has been
               embodied in the highest precedents, and celebrated in the thousand
               jubilees of regenerated liberty, is it forsooth an achievement of modern
               discovery, that such a power is a nullity?&#8212;that all these acts of
               abolition are void, and that the millions disenthralled by them, are, either
               themselves or their posterity, still legally in bondage?

            </p>
            <p>
               4. <em>Legislative power has abolished slavery in its parts</em>. The law
               of South Carolina prohibits the working of slaves more than fifteen
               hours in the twenty-four. [<em>See</em><em>Brevard's Digest</em>,
               253.] In other words, it takes from the slaveholder his power over nine hours
               of the slave's time daily; and if it can take nine hours it may take
               twenty-four&#8212;if two-fifths, then five-fifths. The laws of Georgia
               prohibit the working of slaves on the first day of the week; and if they can
               do it for the first, they can for the six following. Laws embodying
               the same principle have existed for ages in nearly all governments
               that have tolerated slavery.

            </p>
            <p>
               The law of North Carolina prohibits the "immoderate" correction
               of slaves. If it has power to prohibit <em>immoderate</em> correction, it
               can prohibit <em>moderate</em> correction&#8212;<em>all</em>
               correction, which would be virtual emancipation; for, take from the master the
               power to inflict pain, and he is master no longer. Cease to ply the slave with
               the stimulus of fear, and he is free. Laws similar to this exist in
               slaveholding governments generally.

            </p>
            <p>
               The Constitution of Mississippi gives the General Assembly power
               to make laws "to oblige the owners of slaves to <em>treat them with
                  humanity</em>." The Constitution of Missouri has the same clause, and an
               additional one making it the DUTY of the legislature to pass such laws
               as may be necessary to secure the <em>humane</em> treatment of the slaves.
               This grant of power to those legislatures empowers them to decide

               what <em>is</em> and what is <em>not</em> "humane treatment."
               Otherwise it gives no "power"&#8212;the clause is mere waste paper, and flouts
               in the face of a mocked and befooled legislature. A clause giving power to
               require "humane treatment" covers all the <em>particulars</em> of such
               treatment&#8212;gives power to exact it in all
               <em>respects&#8212;requiring</em> certain acts, and
               <em>prohibiting</em> others&#8212;maiming, branding, chaining together,
               allowing each but a quart of corn a day,<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE4r5_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE4r5_FN1"></a> and but "one shirt and one pair
               of pantaloons" in six months<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE5_FN2"><sup>B</sup></a><a name="FootE5_FN2"></a>&#8212;separating families, destroying marriages,
               floggings for learning the alphabet and reading the Bible&#8212;robbing
               them of their oath, of jury trial, and of the right to worship
               God according to conscience&#8212;the legislature has power to specify
               each of these acts&#8212;declare that it is not "<em>humane</em>
               treatment," and PROHIBIT it.&#8212;The legislature may also believe that
               driving men and women into the field, and forcing them to work without pay as
               long as they live, is not "humane treatment," and being constitutionally
               bound "to <em>oblige</em>" masters to practise "humane
               treatment"&#8212;they have the <em>power</em> to <em>prohibit
                  such</em> treatment, and are bound to do it.

            <p><a name="NoteE5_FN3"></a><a href="#FootE5_FN3">C</a>: Virginia made slaves real estate by a law passed
               in 1705. (<em>Beverly's Hist. of Va.</em>, p. 98.) I do not find the
               precise time when this law was repealed, probably when Virginia became the
               chief slave breeder for the cotton-growing and sugar-planting country, and
               made young men and women "from fifteen to twenty-five" the main staple
               production of the State.
            </p>
            <p>
               The law of Louisiana requires the master to give his slaves a certain
               amount of food and clothing, (<em>Martin's Digest</em>, 610.) If it can
               oblige the master to give the slave <em>one</em> thing, it can oblige him
               to give him another: if food and clothing, then wages, liberty, his own body.
               Such laws exist in most slaveholding governments.

            </p>
            <p>
               By the slave laws of Connecticut, under which slaves are now held,
               (for even Connecticut is still a slave State,) slaves might receive and
               hold property, and prosecute suits in their own name as plaintiffs:
               [This last was also the law of Virginia in 1795. See Tucker's
               "Dissertation on Slavery," p. 73.] There were also laws making
               marriage contracts legal, in certain contingencies, and punishing
               infringements of them, ["<em>Reeve's Law of Baron and Femme</em>,"
               p. 310-1.] Each of the laws enumerated above, does, <em>in principle</em>,
               abolish slavery; and all of them together abolish it <em>in fact</em>.
               True, not as a <em>whole</em>, and at a <em>stroke</em>, nor all in
               one place; but in its <em>parts</em>, by piecemeal, at
               divers times and places; thus showing that the abolition of slavery is
               within the boundary of <i>legislation</i>.

            </p>
            <p>
               5.<em>The competency of the law-making power to abolish slavery has
                  been recognized by all the slaveholding States, either directly or by
                  implication</em>. Some States recognize it in their
               <em>Constitutions</em>, by giving the legislature power to emancipate
               such slaves as may "have rendered the state some distinguished service," and
               others by express prohibitory restrictions. The Constitutions of Mississippi,
               Arkansas, and other States, restrict the power of the legislature in this
               respect. Why this express prohibition, if the law-making power cannot abolish
               slavery? A stately farce, indeed, formally to construct a special
               clause, and with appropriate rites induct it into the Constitution, for
               the express purpose of restricting a nonentity!&#8212;to take from the
               lawmaking power what it <em>never had</em>, and what <em>cannot</em>
               pertain to it! The legislatures of those States have no power to abolish
               slavery, simply because their Constitutions have expressly <em>taken
                  away</em> that power. The people of Arkansas, Mississippi, &amp;c., well
               knew the competency of the law-making power to abolish slavery, and hence
               their zeal to <em>restrict</em> it. The fact that these and other States
               have inhibited their legislatures from the exercise of this power, shows that
               the abolition of slavery is acknowledged to be a proper subject of
               legislation, when Constitutions impose no restrictions.

            </p>
            <p>
               The slaveholding States have recognised this power in their
               <em>laws</em>. The Virginia Legislature passed a law in 1786 to prevent
               the further importation of Slaves, of which the following is an
               extract: "And be it further enacted that every slave imported into
               this commonwealth contrary to the true intent and meaning of this
               act, shall upon such importation become <em>free</em>." By a law of
               Virginia, passed Dec. 17, 1792, a slave brought into the state and kept
               <em>there a year</em>, was <em>free</em>. The Maryland Court of
               Appeals at the December term 1813 (see case of Stewart
               <i>vs.</i> Oakes,) decided that a slave owned
               in Maryland, and sent by his master into Virginia to work at different
               periods, making one year in the whole, became <em>free</em>, being
               <i>emancipated</i> by the law of Virginia quoted above.
               North Carolina and Georgia in their acts of cession, transferring to the
               United States the territory now constituting the States of Tennessee, Alabama
               and Mississippi, made it a condition of the grant, that the provisions of the
               ordinance of '87, should be secured to the inhabitants <em>with the
                  exception of the sixth article which prohibits slavery</em>; thus conceding,
               both the competency of law to abolish slavery, and the power of Congress to do
               it, within its jurisdiction. Besides, these acts show the prevalent belief at
               that time, in the slaveholding States, that the general government had adopted
               a line of policy aiming at the exclusion of slavery from the entire territory
               of the United States, not included within the original States, and
               that this policy would be pursued unless prevented by specific and formal
               stipulation.

            </p>
            <p>
               Slaveholding states have asserted this power <em>in their judicial
                  decisions.</em> In numerous cases their highest courts have decided that if
               the legal owner of slaves takes them into those States where slavery has
               been abolished either by law or by the constitution, such removal
               emancipates

               them, such law or constitution abolishing their slavery. This principle is
               asserted in the decision of the Supreme Court of Louisiana,
               in the case of Lunsford <i>vs.</i> Coquillon, 14 Martin's
               La. Reps. 401. Also by the Supreme Court of Virginia, in the case of Hunter
               <i>vs.</i> Fulcher, 1 Leigh's Reps. 172. The same doctrine
               was laid down by Judge Washington, of the United States Supreme Court, in the
               case of Butler <i>vs.</i> Hopper, Washington's Circuit
               Court Reps. 508. This principle was also decided by the Court of Appeals in
               Kentucky; case of Rankin <i>vs.</i> Lydia, 2 Marshall's
               Reps. 407; see also, Wilson <i>vs.</i> Isbell, 5
               Call's Reps. 425, Spotts <i>vs.</i> Gillespie, 6
               Randolph's Reps. 566. The State <i>vs.</i> Lasselle, 1
               Blackford's Reps. 60, Marie Louise <i>vs.</i> Mariot, 8
               La. Reps. 475. In this case, which was tried in 1836, the slave had
               been taken by her master to France and brought back; Judge Mathews,
               of the Supreme Court of Louisiana, decided that "residence
               for one moment" under the laws of France emancipated her.

               6. <em>Eminent statesmen, themselves slaveholders, have conceded this
                  power</em>. Washington, in a letter to Robert Morris, dated April 12,
               1786, says: "There is not a man living, who wishes more sincerely
               than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition of slavery; but there
               is only one proper and effectual mode by which it can be accomplished,
               and that is by <i>legislative</i> authority." In a letter
               to Lafayette, dated May 10, 1786, he says: "It (the abolition of slavery)
               certainly might, and assuredly ought to be effected, and that too by
               <i>legislative</i> authority." In a letter to John Fenton
               Mercer, dated Sept. 9, 1786, he says: "It is among my first wishes to see some
               plan adopted by which slavery in this country may be abolished by
               <em>law</em>." In a letter to Sir John Sinclair, he says: "There are in
               Pennsylvania, <em>laws</em> for the gradual abolition of slavery, which
               neither Maryland nor Virginia have at present, but which nothing is more
               certain that that they <em>must have</em>, and at a period not remote."
               Speaking of movements in the Virginia Legislature in 1777, for the passage of
               a law emancipating the slaves, Mr. Jefferson says: "The principles of the
               amendment were agreed on, that is to say, the freedom of all born after a
               certain day; but it was found that the public mind would not bear the
               proposition, yet the day is not far distant, when <em>it must bear and adopt
                  it</em>."&#8212;Jefferson's Memoirs, v. 1, p. 35. It is well known that
               Jefferson, Pendleton, Mason, Wythe and Lee, while acting as a committee of the
               Virginia House of Delegates to revise the State Laws, prepared a plan
               for the gradual emancipation of the slaves by law. These men were
               the great lights of Virginia. Mason, the author of the Virginia Constitution;
               Pendleton, the President of the memorable Virginia Convention
               in 1787, and President of the Virginia Court of Appeals; Wythe
               was the Blackstone of the Virginia bench, for a quarter of a century
               Chancellor of the State, the professor of law in the University of William
               and Mary, and the preceptor of Jefferson, Madison, and Chief
               Justice Marshall. He was author of the celebrated remonstrance to
               the English House of Commons on the subject of the stamp act. As
               to Jefferson, his <em>name</em> is his biography.

            </p>
            <p>
               Every slaveholding member of Congress from the States of Maryland,
               Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, voted for the
               celebrated ordinance of 1787, which <em>abolished</em> the slavery then
               existing in the Northwest Territory. Patrick Henry, in his well known letter
               to Robert Pleasants, of Virginia, January 18, 1773, says: "I believe
               a time will come when an opportunity will be offered to
               <em>abolish</em> this lamentable evil." William Pinkney, of Maryland,
               advocated the abolition of slavery by law, in the legislature of that State,
               in 1789. Luther Martin urged the same measure both in the Federal Convention,
               and in his report to the Legislature of Maryland. In 1796, St. George
               Tucker, professor of law in the University of William and Mary, and
               Judge of the General Court, published an elaborate dissertation on slavery,
               addressed to the General Assembly of the State, and urging upon
               them the abolition of slavery by <em>law</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               John Jay, while New-York was yet a slave State, and himself in law
               a slaveholder, said in a letter from Spain, in 1786, "An excellent law
               might be made out of the Pennsylvania one, for the gradual abolition
               of slavery. Were I in your legislature, I would present a bill for the
               purpose, drawn up with great care, and I would never cease moving it
               till it became a law, or I ceased to be a member."

            </p>
            <p>
               Daniel D. Tompkins, in a message to the Legislature of New-York,
               January 8, 1812, said: "To devise the means for the gradual and ultimate
               <em>extermination</em> from amongst us of slavery, is work worthy the
               representatives of a polished and enlightened nation."

            </p>
            <p>
               The Virginia Legislature asserted this power in 1832. At the
               close of a month's debate, the following proceedings were had. I extract
               from an editorial article of the Richmond Whig, of January 26,
               1832.

            </p>
            <p>
               "The report of the Select Committee, adverse to legislation on the subject of
               Abolition, was in these words: <em>Resolved</em>, as the opinion
               of this Committee, that it is INEXPEDIENT FOR THE PRESENT, to
               make any legislative enactments for the abolition of Slavery." This
               Report Mr. Preston moved to reverse, and thus to declare that it
               <em>was</em> expedient, <em>now</em> to make Legislative enactments
               for the abolition of slavery. This was meeting the question in its strongest
               form. It demanded action, and immediate action. On this proposition the vote
               was 58 to 73. Many of the most decided friends of abolition voted
               against the amendment; because they thought public opinion not sufficiently
               prepared for it, and that it might prejudice the cause to move
               too rapidly. The vote on Mr. Witcher's motion to postpone the whole
               subject indefinitely, indicates the true state of opinion in the
               House.&#8212;That was the test question, and was so intended and proclaimed by
               its mover. That motion was <em>negatived</em>, 71 to 60; showing a
               majority of 11, who by that vote, declared their belief that "at the proper
               time, and in the proper mode, Virginia ought to commence a system
               of gradual abolition."

            </p>
            <p>
               8. <em>The Congress of the United States have asserted this power</em>.
               The ordinance of '87, declaring that there should be "neither slavery

               nor involuntary servitude," in the North Western territory, abolished
               the slavery then existing there. The Supreme Court of Mississippi,
               in its decision in the case of Harvey <i>vs.</i> Decker,
               Walker's Mi. Reps. 36, declared that the ordinance emancipated the slaves then
               held there. In this decision the question is argued ably and at great length.
               The Supreme Court of Louisiana made the same decision in the case of Forsyth
               <i>vs.</i> Nash, 4 Martin's La. Reps 385. The same
               doctrine was laid down by Judge Porter, (late United States Senator from
               Louisiana,) in his decision at the March term of the La. Supreme
               Court, 1830, in the case of Merry <i>vs.</i> Chexnaider,
               20 Martin's Reps. 699.

            </p>
            <p>
               That the ordinance abolished the slavery then existing, is also shown
               by the fact, that persons holding slaves in the territory petitioned for the
               repeal of the article abolishing slavery, assigning that as a reason. "The
               petition of the citizens of Randolph and St. Clair counties in the Illinois
               country, stating that they were in possession of slaves, and praying the
               repeal of that act (the 6th article of the ordinance of '87) and the passage
               of a law legalizing slavery there." [Am. State papers, Public Lands, v. 1.
               p. 69,] Congress passed this ordinance before the United States Constitution
               was adopted, when it derived all
               its authority from the articles of Confederation, which conferred powers
               of legislation far more restricted than those conferred on Congress over
               the District and Territories by the United States Constitution. Now, we ask,
               how does the Constitution <em>abridge</em> the powers which
               Congress possessed under the articles of confederation?

            </p>
            <p>
               The abolition of the slave trade by Congress, in 1808, is another
               illustration of the competency of legislative power to abolish slavery.
               The African slave trade has become such a mere
               <i>technic</i>, in common
               parlance, that the fact of its being <i>proper slavery</i>
               is overlooked. The buying and selling, the transportation, and the horrors of
               the middle passage, were mere <em>incidents</em> of the slavery in which
               the victims were held. Let things be called by their own names. When Congress
               abolished the African slave trade, it abolished SLAVERY&#8212;supreme
               slavery&#8212;power frantic with license, trampling a whole hemisphere
               scathed with its fires, and running down with blood. True, Congress
               did not, in the abolition of the slave trade, abolish <em>all</em> the
               slavery within its jurisdiction, but it did abolish all the slavery in
               <em>one part</em> of its jurisdiction. What has rifled it of power to
               abolish slavery in <em>another</em> part of its jurisdiction, especially
               in that part where it has "exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever?"

            </p>
            <p>
               9. <em>The Constitution of the United States recognizes this power by
                  the most conclusive implication</em>. In Art. 1, sec. 3, clause 1, it
               prohibits the abolition of the slave trade previous to 1808: thus implying the
               power of Congress to do it at once, but for the restriction; and its power
               to do it <em>unconditionally</em>, when that restriction ceased. Again: In
               Art. 4, sec. 2, "No person held to service or labor in one state under the
               laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or
               regulation therein, be discharged from said service or labor."

               This clause was inserted, as all admit, to prevent the runaway slave
               from being emancipated by the <em>laws</em> of the free states. If these
               laws had <em>no power</em> to emancipate, why this constitutional guard
               to prevent it?

            </p>
            <p>
               The insertion of the clause, was the testimony of the eminent jurists
               that framed the Constitution, to the existence of the <em>power</em>, and
               their public proclamation, that the abolition of slavery was within the
               appropriate sphere of legislation. The right of the owner to that which
               is rightfully property, is founded on a principle of
               <i>universal law</i>, and is recognised and protected by
               all civilized nations; property in slaves is, by general consent, an
               <em>exception</em>; hence slaveholders insisted upon the insertion of
               this clause in the United States Constitution that they might secure by an
               <i>express provision</i>, that from which protection is
               withheld, by the acknowledged principles of universal
               law.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE5_FN4"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE5_FN4"></a> By demanding
               this provision, slaveholders consented that their slaves should
               not be recognised as property by the United States Constitution, and
               hence they found their claim, on the fact of their being
               "<em>persons</em>, and <i>held</i> to service."

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE5_FN4"></a><a href="#FootE5_FN4">A</a>: The fact, that under the articles of
               Confederation, slaveholders, whose slaves had escaped into free states, had no

               power to recover, by process of law, their slaves who escape to Canada, the

               brought him to Maryland in '93, was pronounced free by the Maryland Court of
               Appeals&#8212;these, with other facts and cases "too numerous to mention,"
               are illustrations of the acknowledged truth here asserted, that by the consent
               of the civilized world, and on the principles of universal law, slaves are not
               "<i>property</i>," but
               <i>self-proprietors</i>, and that whenever held as
               property under <em>law</em>, it is only by <i>positive
                  legislative acts</i>, forcibly setting aside the law of nature, the
               common law, and the principles of universal justice and right between man and
               man,&#8212;principles paramount to all law, and from which alone law derives
               its intrinsic authoritative sanction.
            </p>
            <p>
               But waiving all concessions, whether of constitutions, laws, judicial
               decisions, or common consent, I take the position that the power
               of Congress to abolish slavery in the District, follows from the fact,
               that as the sole legislature there, it has unquestionable power <em>to adopt
                  the Common Law, as the legal system within its exclusive jurisdiction</em>.
               This has been done, with certain restrictions, in most of the States,
               either by legislative acts or by constitutional implication. THE COMMON
               LAW KNOWS NO SLAVES. Its principles annihilate slavery wherever
               they touch it. It is a universal, unconditional, abolition act.
               Wherever slavery is a legal system, it is so only by
               <i>statute</i> law, and in violation of common law.
               The declaration of Lord Chief Justice Holt, that "by the common law, no man
               can have property in another," is an acknowledged axiom, and based upon the
               well known common law definition of property. "The subjects of
               dominion or property are <i>things</i>, as
               contra-distinguished from <i>persons</i>."
               Let Congress adopt the common law in the District of Columbia, and
               slavery there is at once abolished. Congress may well be at home

               in common law legislation, for the common law is the grand element
               of the United States Constitution. All its <em>fundamental</em> provisions
               are instinct with its spirit; and its existence, principles and paramount
               authority, are presupposed and assumed throughout the whole. The preamble
               of the Constitution plants the standard of the Common Law
               immovably in its foreground. "We, the people of the United States,
               in order to ESTABLISH JUSTICE, &amp;c., do ordain and establish this
               Constitution;" thus proclaiming <em>devotion to justice</em>, as the
               controlling motive in the organization of the Government, and its secure
               establishment the chief object of its aims. By this most solemn recognition,
               the common law, that grand legal embodiment of "<em>justice</em>" and
               fundamental right was made the groundwork of the Constitution, and
               intrenched behind its strongest munitions. The second clause of Sec.
               9, Art. 1; Sec. 4, Art. 2, and the last clause of Sec. 2, Art. 3, with
               Articles 7, 8, 9, and 13 of the Amendments, are also express recognitions
               of the common law as the presiding Genius of the Constitution.

            </p>
            <p>
               By adopting the common law within its exclusive jurisdiction Congress
               would carry out the principles of our glorious Declaration, and
               follow the highest precedents in our national history and jurisprudence.
               It is a political maxim as old as civil legislation, that laws should
               be strictly homogeneous with the principles of the government whose
               will they express, embodying and carrying them out&#8212;being indeed
               the <em>principles themselves</em>, in preceptive
               form&#8212;representatives alike of the nature and the power of the
               Government&#8212;standing illustrations of its genius and spirit, while they
               proclaim and enforce its authority. Who needs be told that slavery is in
               antagonism to the principles of the Declaration, and the spirit of the
               Constitution, and that these and the principles of the common law gravitate
               toward each other with irrepressible affinities, and mingle into one? The
               common law came hither with our pilgrim fathers; it was their birthright,
               their panoply, their glory, and their song of rejoicing in the house of their
               pilgrimage. It covered them in the day of their calamity, and their trust
               was under the shadow of its wings. From the first settlement of the
               country, the genius of our institutions and our national spirit have
               claimed it as a common possession, and exulted in it with a common
               pride. A century ago, Governor Pownall, one of the most eminent
               constitutional jurists of colonial times, said of the common law, "In
               all the colonies the common law is received as the foundation and
               main body of their law." In the Declaration of Rights, made by the
               Continental Congress at its first session in '74, there was the following
               resolution: "Resolved, That the respective colonies are entitled to the
               common law of England, and especially to the great and inestimable
               privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage according to the
               course of that law." Soon after the organization of the general government,
               Chief Justice Ellsworth, in one of his decisions on the bench
               of the United States Supreme Court, said: "The common law of this
               country remains the same as it was before the revolution." Chief
               Justice Marshall, in his decision in the case of Livingston
               <i>vs.</i> Jefferson,

               said: "When our ancestors migrated to America, they brought with
               them the common law of their native country, so far as it was applicable
               to their new situation and I do not conceive that the revolution
               in any degree changed the relations of man to man, or the law which
               regulates them. In breaking our political connection with the parent
               state, we did not break our connection with each other." [<em>See</em><em>Hall's Law Journal, new series.</em>] Mr. Duponceau, in his
               "Dissertation on the Jurisdiction of Courts in the United States," says, "I
               consider the common law of England the <i>jus
                  commune</i> of the United States. I think I can lay it down as a correct
               principle, that the common law of England, as it was at the time of the
               declaration of Independence, still continues to be the national law of this
               country, so far as it is applicable to our present state, and subject to the
               modifications it has received here in the course of nearly half a
               century." Chief Justice Taylor of North Carolina, in his decision in
               the case of the State <i>vs.</i> Reed, in 1823, Hawkes'
               N.C. Reps. 454, says, "a law of <em>paramount obligation to the
                  statute</em> was violated by the offence&#8212;COMMON LAW, founded upon the
               law of nature, and confirmed by revelation." The legislation of the United
               States abounds in recognitions of the principles of the common law, asserting
               their paramount binding power. Sparing details, of which our national
               state papers are full, we illustrate by a single instance. It was made
               a condition of the admission of Louisiana into the Union, that the right
               of trial by jury should be secured to all her citizens,&#8212;the United
               States government thus employing its power to enlarge the jurisdiction
               of the common law in this its great representative.

            </p>
            <p>
               Having shown that the abolition of slavery is within the competency
               of the law-making power, when unrestricted by constitutional
               provisions, and that the legislation of Congress over the District
               <em>is</em> thus unrestricted, its power to abolish slavery there is
               established.

            </p>
            <p>
               Besides this general ground, the power of Congress to abolish
               slavery in the District may be based upon another equally tenable.
               We argue it from the fact, that slavery exists there <em>now</em> by an
               act of Congress. In the act of 16th July, 1790, Congress accepted portions
               of territory offered by the states of Maryland and Virginia, and
               enacted that the laws, as they then were, should continue in force,
               "until Congress shall otherwise by law provide;" thus making the
               slave codes of Maryland and Virginia its own. Under these laws,
               adopted by Congress, and in effect re-enacted and made laws of the
               District, the slaves there are now held.

            </p>
            <p>
               Is Congress so impotent in its own "exclusive jurisdiction" that
               it <em>cannot</em> "otherwise by law provide?" If it can say, what
               <em>shall</em> be considered property, it can say what shall
               <em>not</em> be considered property. Suppose a legislature enacts, that
               marriage contracts shall be mere bills of sale, making a husband the
               proprietor of his wife, as his <i>bona fide</i>
               property; and suppose husbands should herd their wives in droves
               for the market as beasts of burden, or for the brothel as victims of
               lust, and then prate about their inviolable legal property, and deny

               the power of the legislature, which stamped them property, to undo
               its own wrong, and secure to wives by law the rights of human beings.
               Would such cant about "legal rights" be heeded where reason and
               justice held sway, and where law, based upon fundamental morality,
               received homage? If a frantic legislature pronounces woman a
               chattel, has it no power, with returning reason, to take back the blasphemy?
               Is the impious edict irrepealable? Be it, that with legal
               forms it has stamped wives "wares." Can no legislation blot out the
               brand? Must the handwriting of Deity on human nature be expunged
               for ever? Has law no power to stay the erasing pen, and tear off
               the scrawled label that covers up the IMAGE OF GOD? We now proceed
               to show that

               THE POWER OF CONGRESS TO ABOLISH SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT HAS BEEN, TILL

            </h3>
            <p>
               1. It has been assumed by Congress itself. The following record
               stands on the journals of the House of Representatives for 1804, p.
               225: "On motion made and seconded that the House do come to the
               following resolution: 'Resolved, That from and after the 4th day of
               July, 1805, all blacks and people of color that shall be born within
               the District of Columbia, or whose mothers shall be the property of
               any person residing within said District, shall be free, the males at
               the age of ----, and the females at the age of ----. The main question
               being taken that the House do agree to said motion as originally proposed,
               it was negatived by a majority of 46.'" Though the motion
               was lost, it was on the ground of its alleged <em>inexpediency</em> alone,
               and not because Congress lacked the constitutional power. In the debate
               which preceded the vote, the <em>power</em> of Congress was conceded. In
               March, 1816, the House of Representatives passed the following
               resolution:&#8212;"Resolved, That a committee be appointed to inquire into
               the existence of an inhuman and illegal traffic in slaves, carried on in
               and through the District of Columbia, and to report whether any and
               what measures are necessary for <em>putting a stop to the same</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               On the 9th of January, 1829, the House of Representatives passed
               the following resolution by a vote of 114 to 66: "Resolved, That the
               Committee on the District of Columbia be instructed to inquire into the
               <em>expediency</em> of providing by <em>law</em> for the gradual
               abolition of slavery within the District, in such manner that the interests of
               no individual shall be injured thereby." Among those who voted in the
               affirmative were Messrs. Barney of Md., Armstrong of Va., A.H. Shepperd of
               N.C., Blair of Tenn., Chilton and Lyon of Ky., Johns of Delaware,
               and others from slave states.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. It has been conceded directly, or impliedly, by all the committees
               on the District of Columbia that have reported on the subject.
               In a report of the committee on the District, Jan. 11, 1837, by their
               chairman, Mr. Powell of Virginia, there is the following declaration
               "The Congress of the United States, has by the constitution exclusive
               jurisdiction over the District, and has power upon this subject,
               (<i>slavery</i>)

               as upon all other subjects of legislation, to exercise <em>unlimited
                  discretion</em>." Reps. of Comms. 2d Session, 19th Cong. v. I. No. 43. In
               February, 1829, the committee on the District, Mr. Alexander of
               Virginia, Chairman, in their report pursuant to Mr. Miner's resolutions,
               recognize a contingent abolition proceeding upon the consent of
               the people. In December, 1831, the committee on the District, Mr.
               Doddridge of Virginia, Chairman, reported, "That until the adjoining
               states act on the subject (slavery) it would be (not
               <em>unconstitutional</em> but) unwise and impolitic, if not unjust, for
               Congress to interfere." In April, 1836, a special committee on abolition
               memorials reported the following resolutions by their Chairman, Mr. Pinckney
               of South Carolina: "Resolved, that Congress possesses no constitutional
               authority to interfere in any way with the institution of slavery in any
               of the states of this confederacy."

            </p>
            <p>
               "Resolved, That Congress <em>ought not to interfere</em> in any way with
               slavery in the District of Columbia." "Ought not to interfere," carefully
               avoiding the phraseology of the first resolution, and thus in effect
               conceding the constitutional power. In a widely circulated "Address
               to the electors of the Charleston District," Mr. Pinckney is thus denounced
               by his own constituents: "He has proposed a resolution
               which is received by the plain common sense of the whole country as
               a concession that Congress has authority to abolish slavery in the
               District of Columbia."

            </p>
            <p>
               3. It has been conceded by the <em>citizens of the District</em>. A
               petition for the gradual abolition of slavery in the District, signed by
               nearly eleven hundred of its citizens, was presented to Congress, March 24,
               1837. Among the signers to this petition, were Chief Justice Cranch,
               Judge Van Ness, Judge Morsel, Prof. J.M. Staughton, Rev. Dr.
               Balch, Rev. Dr. Keith, John M. Munroe, and a large number of the
               most influential inhabitants of the District. Mr. Dickson, of New
               York, asserted on the floor of Congress in 1835, that the signers of
               this petition owned more than half of the property in the District.
               The accuracy of this statement has never been questioned.

            </p>
            <p>
               This power has been conceded by <em>grand juries of the District</em>.
               The grand jury of the county of Alexandria, at the March term 1802,
               presented the domestic slave trade as a grievance, and said, "We
               consider these grievances demanding <em>legislative</em> redress."
               Jan. 19, 1829, Mr. Alexander, of Virginia, presented a representation of the
               grand jury in the city of Washington, remonstrating against "any
               measure for the abolition of slavery within said District, unless accompanied
               by measures for the removal of the emancipated from the
               same;" thus, not only conceding the power to emancipate slaves, but
               affirming an additional power, that of <em>excluding them when free</em>.
               See Journal H.R. 1828-9, p. 174.

            </p>
            <p>
               4. This power has been conceded <em>by State Legislatures</em>. In 1828
               the Legislature of Pennsylvania instructed their Senators in Congress
               "to procure, if practicable, the passage of a law to abolish slavery
               in the District of Columbia." Jan. 28, 1829, the House of Assembly

               of New York passed a resolution, that their "Senators in Congress
               be instructed to make every possible exertion to effect the passage of
               a law for the abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia." In
               February, 1837, the Senate of Massachusetts "Resolved, That Congress
               having exclusive legislation in the District of Columbia, possess
               the right to abolish slavery and the slave trade therein, and that the
               early exercise of such right is demanded by the enlightened sentiment
               of the civilized world, by the principles of the revolution, and by humanity."
               The House of Representatives passed the following resolution
               at the same session: "Resolved, That Congress having exclusive
               legislation in the District of Columbia, possess the right to abolish
               slavery in said District, and that its exercise should only be restrained
               by a regard to the public good."

            </p>
            <p>
               November 1, 1837, the Legislature of Vermont, "Resolved, that
               Congress have the full power by the constitution to abolish slavery
               and the slave trade in the District of Columbia, and in the territories."
               The Legislature of Vermont passed in substance the same resolution,
               at its session in 1836.

            </p>
            <p>
               May 30, 1836, a committee of the Pennsylvania Legislature reported
               the following resolution: "Resolved, That Congress does possess
               the constitutional power, and it is expedient to abolish slavery
               and the slave trade within the District of Columbia."

            </p>
            <p>
               In January, 1836, the Legislature of South Carolina "Resolved,
               That we should consider the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia
               as a violation of the rights of the citizens of that District derived
               from the <em>implied</em> conditions on which that territory was ceded to
               the General Government." Instead of denying the constitutional power,
               they virtually admit its existence, by striving to smother it under an
               <em>implication</em>. In February, 1836, the Legislature of North Carolina
               "Resolved, That, although by the Constitution all legislative power
               over the District of Columbia is vested in the Congress of the United
               States, yet we would deprecate any legislative action on the part of
               that body towards liberating the slaves of that District, as a breach of
               faith towards those States by whom the territory was originally ceded,
               and will regard such interference as the first step towards a general
               emancipation of the slaves of the South." Here is a full concession
               of the <em>power</em>, February 2, 1836, the Virginia Legislature passed
               unanimously the following resolution: "Resolved, by the General
               Assembly of Virginia, that the following article be proposed to the
               several states of this Union, and to Congress, as an amendment of the
               Constitution of the United States: 'The powers of Congress shall not
               be so construed as to authorize the passage of any law for the emancipation
               of slaves in the District of Columbia, without the consent of
               the individual proprietors thereof, unless by the sanction of the Legislatures
               of Virginia and Maryland, and under such conditions as they
               shall by law prescribe.'"

            </p>
            <p>
               Fifty years after the formation of the United States constitution the
               states are solemnly called upon by the Virginia Legislature, to amend

               that instrument by a clause asserting that, in the grant to Congress of
               "exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever" over the District, the
               "case" of slavery is not included!! What could have dictated such
               a resolution but the conviction that the power to abolish slavery is an
               irresistible interference from the constitution <em>as it is</em>. The
               fact that the same legislature passed afterward a resolution, though by no
               means unanimously, that Congress does not possess the power, abates
               not a tittle of the testimony in the first resolution. March 23d, 1824,
               "Mr. Brown presented the resolutions of the General Assembly of
               Ohio, recommending to Congress the consideration of a system for
               the gradual emancipation of persons of color held in servitude in
               the United States." On the same day, "Mr. Noble, of Indiana, communicated
               a resolution from the legislature of that state, respecting
               the gradual emancipation of slaves within the United States." Journal
               of the United States Senate, for 1824-5, p. 231.

            </p>
            <p>
               The Ohio and Indiana resolutions, by taking for granted the
               <em>general</em> power of Congress over the subject of slavery, do
               virtually assert its <em>special</em> power within its
               <em>exclusive</em> jurisdiction.

            </p>
            <p>
               5. The power of Congress to abolish slavery in the District, has
               been conceded by bodies of citizens in the slave states. The petition
               of eleven hundred citizens of the District of Columbia, in 1827, has
               been already mentioned. "March 5, 1830, Mr. Washington presented
               a memorial of inhabitants of the county of Frederick, in the state
               of Maryland, praying that provision may be made for the gradual abolition
               of slavery in the District of Columbia." Journal H.R. 1829-30,
               p. 358.

            </p>
            <p>
               March 30, 1828. Mr. A.H. Shepperd, of North Carolina, presented
               a memorial of citizens of that state, "praying Congress to take
               measures fur the entire abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia."
               Journal H.R. 1829-30, p. 379.

            </p>
            <p>
               January 14, 1822. Mr. Rhea, of Tennessee, presented a memorial
               of citizens of that state, praying "that provision may be made,
               whereby all slaves which may hereafter be born in the District of Columbia,
               shall be free at a certain period of their lives." Journal H.R.
               1821-22, p. 142.

            </p>
            <p>
               December 13, 1824. Mr. Saunders of North Carolina, presented
               a memorial of citizens of that state, praying "that measures may
               be taken for the gradual abolition of slavery in the United States."
               Journal H.R. 1824-25, p. 27.

            </p>
            <p>
               December 16, 1828. "Mr. Barnard presented the memorial of the
               American Convention for promoting the abolition of slavery, held in
               Baltimore, praying that slavery may be abolished in the District of
               Columbia." Journal U.S. Senate, 1828-29, p. 24.

            </p>
            <p>
               6. Distinguished statesmen and jurists in the slaveholding states,
               have conceded the power of Congress to abolish slavery in the District.
               The testimony of Messrs. Doddridge, Powell, and Alexander, of Virginia,
               Chief Justice Cranch, and Judges Morsell and Van Ness, of the
               District, has already been given. In the debate in Congress on the

               memorial of the Society of Friends, in 1790, Mr. Madison, in speaking
               of the territories of the United States, explicitly declared, from his
               own knowledge of the views of the members of the convention that
               framed the constitution, as well as from the obvious import of its terms,
               that in the territories "Congress have certainly the power to regulate
               the subject of slavery." Congress can have no more power over the
               territories than that of "exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever,"
               consequently, according to Mr. Madison, "it has certainly the power
               to regulate the subject of slavery in the" <em>District</em>. In March,
               1816, John Randolph introduced a resolution for putting a stop to the domestic
               slave trade within the District. December 12, 1827, Mr. Barney,
               of Maryland, presented a memorial for abolition in the District,
               and moved that it be printed. Mr. McDuffie, of South Carolina, objected
               to the printing, but "expressly admitted the right of Congress
               to grant to the people of the District any measures which they might
               deem necessary to free themselves from the deplorable evil."&#8212;(See
               letter of Mr. Claiborne, of Mississippi, to his constituents, published in
               the Washington Globe, May 9, 1836.) The sentiments of Henry
               Clay on the subject are well known. In a speech before the U.S.
               Senate, in 1836, he declared the power of Congress to abolish slavery
               in the District "unquestionable." Messrs. Blair, of Tennessee, Chilton,
               Lyon, and Richard M. Johnson, of Kentucky, A.H. Shepperd,
               of North Carolina, Messrs. Armstrong and Smyth, of Virginia, Messrs.
               Dorsey, Archer, and Barney, of Maryland, and Johns, of Delaware,
               with numerous others from slave states, have asserted the power of
               Congress to abolish slavery in the District. In the speech of Mr.
               Smyth, of Virginia, on the Missouri question, January 28, 1820, he
               says on this point: "If the future freedom of the blacks is your real
               object, and not a mere pretence, why do you not begin <em>here</em>?
               Within the ten miles square, you have <em>undoubted power</em> to exercise
               exclusive legislation. <em>Produce a bill to emancipate the slaves in the
                  District of Columbia</em>, or, if you prefer it, to emancipate those born
               hereafter."

            </p>
            <p>
               To this may be added the testimony of the present Vice President
               of the United States, Hon. Richard M. Johnson, of Kentucky. In a
               speech before the United States' Senate, February 1, 1820, (National
               Intelligencer, April 29, 1820,) he says: "Congress has the express
               power stipulated by the Constitution, to exercise exclusive legislation
               over this District of ten miles square. Here slavery is sanctioned by
               law. In the District of Columbia, containing a population of 30,000
               souls, and probably as many slaves as the whole territory of Missouri,
               THE POWER OF PROVIDING FOR THEIR EMANCIPATION RESTS WITH
               CONGRESS ALONE. Why, then, let me ask, Mr. President, why all this
               sensibility&#8212;this commiseration&#8212;this heart-rending sympathy for the
               slaves of Missouri, and this cold insensibility, this eternal apathy,
               towards the slaves in the District of Columbia?"

            </p>
            <p>
               It is quite unnecessary to add, that the most distinguished northern
               statesmen of both political parties, have always affirmed the power of
               Congress to abolish slavery in the District. President Van Buren in
               his letter of March 6, 1836, to a committee of gentlemen in North

               Carolina, says, "I would not, from the light now before me, feel myself
               safe in pronouncing that Congress does not possess the power of
               abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia." This declaration
               of the President is consistent with his avowed sentiments touching the
               Missouri question, on which he coincided with such men as Daniel D.
               Tompkins, De Witt Clinton, and others, whose names are a
               host.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE5_FN5"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE5_FN5"></a> It is
               consistent also, with his recommendation in his late message on
               the 5th of last month, in which, speaking of the District, he strongly
               urges upon Congress "a thorough and careful revision of its local
               government," speaks of the "entire dependence" of the people of the
               District "upon Congress," recommends that a "uniform system of local
               government" be adopted, and adds, that "although it was selected
               as the seat of the General Government, the site of its public edifices,
               the depository of its archives, and the residence of officers intrusted
               with large amounts of public property, and the management of public
               business, yet it never has been subjected to, or received, that
               <em>special</em> and <em>comprehensive</em> legislation which these
               circumstances peculiarly demanded."

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE5_FN5"></a><a href="#FootE5_FN5">A</a>: Mr. Van Buren, when a member of the Senate of
               New-York, voted for the following preamble and resolutions, which passed
               unanimously:&#8212;Jan. 28th, 1820. "Whereas, the inhibiting the further
               extension of slavery in the United States, is a subject of deep concern to
               the people of this state: and whereas, we consider slavery as an evil much to
               be deplored, and that <em>every constitutional barrier should be interposed
                  to prevent its further extension</em>: and that the constitution of the
               United States <em>clearly gives congress the right</em> to require new
               states, not comprised within the original boundary of the United States, to
               <em>make the prohibition of slavery</em> a condition of their admission
               into the Union: Therefore,


            </p>
            <p>
               "Resolved, That our Senators be instructed, and our members of Congress
               be requested, to oppose the admission as a state into the Union, of any
               territory not comprised as aforesaid, without making <em>the prohibition of
                  slavery</em> therein an indispensable condition of admission."
            </p>
            <p>
               The tenor of Senator Tallmadge's speech on the right of petition,
               in the last Congress, and of Mr. Webster's on the reception of abolition
               memorials, may be taken as universal exponents of the sentiments
               of northern statesmen as to the power of Congress to abolish slavery
               in the District of Columbia.

            </p>
            <p>
               After presenting this array of evidence, <em>direct testimony</em> to show
               that the power of Congress to abolish slavery in the District, has always
               till recently been <em>universally conceded</em>, is perhaps quite
               superfluous. We subjoin; however, the following:

            </p>
            <p>
               The Vice-President of the United States in his speech on the Missouri
               question, quoted above, after contending that the restriction of
               slavery in Missouri would be unconstitutional, adds, "But I am at a
               loss to conceive why gentlemen should arouse all their sympathies
               upon this occasion, when they permit them to lie dormant upon the
               same subject, in relation to other sections of country, in which THEIR
               POWER COULD NOT BE QUESTIONED." Then follows immediately the
               assertion of congressional power to abolish slavery in the District, as

               already quoted. In the speech of Mr. Smyth, of Va., also quoted
               above, he declares the power of Congress to abolish slavery in the
               District to be "UNDOUBTED."

            </p>
            <p>
               Mr. Sutherland, of Pennsylvania, in a speech in the House of Representatives,
               on the motion to print Mr. Pinckney's Report, is thus
               reported in the Washington Globe, of May 9th, '36. "He replied to
               the remark that the report conceded that Congress had a right to
               legislate upon the subject in the District of Columbia, and said that
               SUCH A RIGHT HAD NEVER BEEN, TILL RECENTLY, DENIED."

            </p>
            <p>
               The American Quarterly Review, published at Philadelphia, with
               a large circulation and list of contributors in the slave states, holds
               the following language in the September No. 1833, p. 55: "Under
               this 'exclusive jurisdiction,' granted by the constitution, Congress has
               power to abolish slavery and the slave trade in the District of Columbia.
               It would hardly be necessary to state this as a distinct proposition,
               had it not been occasionally questioned. The truth of the assertion,
               however, is too obvious to admit of argument&#8212;and we believe
               HAS NEVER BEEN DISPUTED BY PERSONS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE
               CONSTITUTION."

            </p>
            <p>
               Finally&#8212;an explicit, and unexpected admission, that an
               "<em>over-whelming majority</em>" of the <em>present</em> Congress
               concede the power to abolish slavery in the District, has just been made by a
               member of Congress from South Carolina, in a letter published in the
               Charleston Mercury of Dec. 27, well known as the mouth-piece of Mr. Calhoun.
               The following is an extract:

            </p>
            <p>
               "The time has arrived when we must have new guarantees under the constitution,
               or the union must be dissolved. <em>Our views of the constitution are not
                  those of the majority. An overwhelming majority think that by the
                  constitution, Congress may abolish slavery in the District of
                  Columbia&#8212;may abolish the slave trade between the States; that is, it may
                  prohibit their being carried out of the State in which they are&#8212;and
                  prohibit it in all the territories, Florida among them. They think</em>,
               NOT WITHOUT STRONG REASONS, <em>that the power of Congress extends to
                  all of these subjects</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               In another letter, the same correspondent says:

            </p>
            <p>
               "<em>The fact is, it is vain to attempt</em>, AS THE CONSTITUTION IS NOW,
               <em>to keep the question of slavery out of the halls of
                  Congress</em>,&#8212;until, by some decisive action, WE COMPEL SILENCE, or

               OBJECTIONS TO THE FOREGOING CONCLUSIONS CONSIDERED.

            </h3>
            <p>
               We now proceed to notice briefly the main arguments that have
               been employed in Congress and elsewhere against the power of Congress
               to abolish slavery in the District. One of the most plausible, is
               that "the conditions on which Maryland and Virginia ceded the District
               to the United States, would be violated, if Congress should abolish
               slavery there." The reply to this is, that Congress had no power to
               <em>accept</em> a cession coupled with conditions restricting the power
               given it by the constitution. Nothing short of a convention of the states,
               and an alteration of the constitution, abridging its grant of power,
               could have empowered Congress to accept a territory on any other
               conditions than that of exercising "exclusive legislation, in all cases
               whatsoever," over it.

            </p>
            <p>
               To show the futility of the objection, here follow the acts of cession.
               The cession of Maryland was made in November, 1788, and
               is as follows: "An act to cede to Congress a district of ten miles
               square in this state for the seat of the government of the United States."

            </p>
            <p>
               "Be it enacted, by the General Assembly of Maryland, that the
               representatives of this state in the House of Representatives of the
               Congress of the United States, appointed to assemble at New-York,
               on the first Wednesday of March next, be, and they are hereby
               authorized and required on the behalf of this state, to cede to the Congress
               of the United States, any district in this state, not exceeding ten
               miles square, which the Congress may fix upon, and accept for the
               seat of government of the United States." Laws of Maryland, vol.
               2, chap. 46.

            </p>
            <p>
               The cession from Virginia was made by act of the Legislature of
               that State on the 3d of December, 1788, in the following words:

            </p>
            <p>
               "Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That a tract of country,
               not exceeding ten miles square, or any lesser quantity, to be located
               within the limits of the State, and in any part thereof, as Congress
               may, by law, direct, shall be, and the same is hereby for ever ceded
               and relinquished to the Congress and Government of the United States,
               in full and absolute right, and exclusive jurisdiction, as well of soil,
               as of persons residing or to reside thereon, pursuant to the tenor and
               effect of the eighth section of the first article of the government of
               the constitution of the United States."

            </p>
            <p>
               But were there no provisos to these acts? The Maryland act had
               <em>none</em>. That part of the District therefore, which includes the
               cities of Washington and Georgetown, can lay claim to nothing with
               which to ward off the power of Congress. The Virginia act had this
               proviso: "Sect. 2. Provided, that nothing herein contained, shall be
               construed to vest in the United States any right of property in the
               <em>soil</em>, or to affect the rights of individuals
               <em>therein</em>, otherwise than the same
               shall or may be transferred by such individuals to the United States."

            </p>
            <p>
               This specification touching the soil was merely definitive and explanatory
               of that clause in the act of cession, "<em>full and absolute right.</em>"
               Instead of restraining the power of Congress on
               <i>slavery</i> and other subjects, it even gives it wider
               scope; for exceptions to <em>parts</em> of a rule, give double
               confirmation to those parts not embraced in the exceptions. If it was the
               <em>design</em> of the proviso to restrict congressional action on the
               subject of <i>slavery</i>, why is the <em>soil
                  alone</em> specified? As legal instruments are not paragons of economy in
               words, might not "John Doe," out of his abundance, and without spoiling his
               style, have afforded an additional word&#8212;at least a hint&#8212;that
               slavery was
               <em>meant</em>, though nothing was <em>said</em> about it? The subject
               must have been too "delicate," even for the most distant allusion! The mystery
               of silence is solved!!

            </p>
            <p>
               But again, Maryland and Virginia, in their acts of cession, declare
               them to be "in pursuance of" that clause of the constitution which
               gives to Congress "exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over"
               the ten miles square&#8212;thus, instead of <em>restricting</em> that
               clause, both States gave an express and decided confirmation of it. Now, their
               acts of cession either accorded with that clause of the constitution,
               or they conflicted with it. If they conflicted with it, <em>accepting</em>
               the cessions was a violation of the constitution. If they accorded, the
               objector has already had his answer. The fact that Congress accepted
               the cessions, proves that in its view their <em>terms</em> did not
               conflict with the constitutional grant of "power to exercise exclusive
               legislation in all cases whatsoever over such District." The inquiry whether
               these acts of cession were consistent or inconsistent with the United
               States constitution, is totally irrelevant to the question at issue. What
               saith the CONSTITUTION? That is the question. Not, what saith Virginia,
               or Maryland, or&#8212;equally to the point&#8212;John Bull! If Maryland
               and Virginia had been the authorized interpreters of the constitution
               for the Union, these acts of cession could hardly have been
               magnified more than they were by Messrs. Garland and Wise in the
               last Congress. A true understanding of the constitution can be had,
               forsooth, only by holding it up in the light of Maryland and Virginia
               legislation!

            </p>
            <p>
               We are told, again, that those States would not have ceded the
               District if they had supposed the constitution gave Congress power
               to abolish slavery in it.

            </p>
            <p>
               This comes with an ill grace from Maryland and Virginia. They
               <em>knew</em> the constitution. They were parties to it. They had sifted
               it, clause by clause, in their State conventions. They had weighed its
               words in the balance&#8212;they had tested them as by fire; and finally,
               after long pondering, they <em>adopted</em> the constitution. And
               <em>afterward</em>, self-moved, they ceded the ten miles square, and
               declared the cession made "in pursuance of" that oft-cited clause, "Congress
               shall have power to exercise exclusive legalisation in all cases whatsoever
               over such District," &amp;c. And now verily "they would not have ceded if
               they had <em>supposed</em>!" &amp;c. Cede it they <em>did</em>, and
               "in full and absolute right both of soil and persons." Congress accepted the
               cession&#8212;state power over the District ceased, and congressional power
               over it commenced&#8212;and now, the sole question to be settled is,
               <i>the amount of power over the District, lodged in Congress
                  by the constitution</i>. The constitution&#8212;the CONSTITUTION&#8212;that
               is the point. Maryland and Virginia "suppositions" must be potent
               suppositions, to abrogate a clause in the United States Constitution! That
               clause either gives Congress power to abolish slavery in the District, or it
               does <em>not</em>&#8212;and that point is to be settled, not by state
               "suppositions," nor state usages, nor state legislation, but
               <i>by the terms of the clause themselves</i>.

            </p>
            <p>
               Southern members of Congress, in the recent discussions, have conceded
               the power of a contingent abolition in the District, by suspending
               it upon the consent of the people. Such a doctrine from
               <i>declaimers</i> like Messrs. Alford, of Georgia, and
               Walker, of Mississippi, would excite no surprise; but that it should be
               honored with the endorsement of such men as Mr. Rives and Mr. Calhoun, is
               quite unaccountable. Are attributes of <em>sovereignty</em> mere creatures
               of <em>contingency</em>? Is delegated <em>authority</em> mere
               conditional <em>permission</em>? Is a <i>constitutional
                  power</i> to be exercised by those who hold it, only by popular
               <em>sufferance</em>? Must it lie helpless at the pool of public sentiment,
               waiting the gracious troubling of its waters? Is it a lifeless corpse, save
               only when popular "consent" deigns to put breath into its nostrils? Besides,
               if the consent of the people of the District be necessary, the consent
               of the <em>whole</em> people must be had&#8212;not that of a majority,
               however large. Majorities, to be authoritative, must be
               <em>legal</em>&#8212;and a legal majority without legislative power, right
               of representation, or even the electoral franchise, would be an anomaly. In
               the District of Columbia, such a thing as a majority in a legal sense is
               unknown to law. To talk of the power of a majority, or the will of a majority
               there, is mere mouthing. A majority? Then it has an authoritative
               will&#8212;and an organ to make it known&#8212;and an executive to carry it
               into effect&#8212;Where are they? We repeat it&#8212;if the consent of the
               people of the District be necessary, the consent of <em>every one</em>
               is necessary&#8212;and <em>universal</em> consent will come only with the
               Greek Kalends and a "perpetual motion." A single individual might thus
               perpetuate slavery in defiance of the expressed will of a whole people. The
               most common form of this fallacy is given by Mr. Wise, of Virginia,
               in his speech, February 16, 1835, in which he denied the power of
               Congress to abolish slavery in the District, unless the inhabitants
               owning slaves petitioned for it!! Southern members of Congress at
               the present session ring changes almost daily upon the same fallacy.
               What! pray Congress <em>to use</em> a power which it <em>has not</em>?
               "It is required of a man according to what he <em>hath</em>," saith the
               Scripture. I commend Mr. Wise to Paul for his ethics. Would that he had got
               his <em>logic</em> of him! If Congress does not possess the power, why
               taunt it with its weakness, by asking its exercise? Why mock it by demanding
               impossibilities? Petitioning, according to Mr. Wise, is, in matters of
               legislation, omnipotence itself; the very source of all constitutional
               power; for, <em>asking</em> Congress to do what it <em>cannot</em> do,
               gives it the power&#8212;to pray the exercise of a power that is <em>not,
                  creates</em> it. A beautiful theory! Let us work it both ways. If to
               petition for the exercise of a power that is <em>not</em>, creates
               it&#8212;to petition against the exercise of a power that <em>is</em>,
               annihilates it. As southern gentlemen are partial to summary processes, pray,
               sirs, try the virtue of your own recipe on "exclusive legislation in all cases
               whatsoever;" a better subject for experiment and test of the prescription
               could not be had. But if the petitions of the citizens of the District give
               Congress the <em>right</em> to abolish slavery, they impose the
               <em>duty</em>; if they confer constitutional

               authority, they create constitutional obligation. If Congress <em>may</em>
               abolish because of an expression of their will, it <em>must</em> abolish
               at the bidding of that will. If the people of the District are a
               <em>source of power</em> to Congress, their <em>expressed will</em>
               has the force of a constitutional provision, and has the same binding power
               upon the National Legislature. To make Congress dependent on the District for
               authority, is to make it a <em>subject</em> of its authority, restraining
               the exercise of its own discretion, and sinking it into a mere organ of the
               District's will. We proceed to another objection.

            </p>
            <p>
               "The southern states would not have ratified the constitution, if
               they had supposed that it gave this power." It is a sufficient answer
               to this objection, that the northern states would not have ratified it, if
               they had supposed that it <em>withheld</em> the power. If "suppositions"
               are to take the place of the constitution&#8212;coming from both sides, they
               neutralize each other. To argue a constitutional question by
               <em>guessing</em> at the "suppositions" that might have been made by the
               parties to it, would find small favor in a court of law. But even a desperate
               shift is some easement when sorely pushed. If this question is to be settled
               by "suppositions," suppositions shall be forth coming, and that without
               stint.

            </p>
            <p>
               First, then, I affirm that the North ratified the constitution, "supposing"
               that slavery had begun to wax old, and would speedily vanish
               away, and especially that the abolition of the slave trade, which by the
               constitution was to be surrendered to Congress after twenty years,
               would cast it headlong.

            </p>
            <p>
               Would the North have adopted the constitution, giving three-fifths
               of the "slave property" a representation, if it has "supposed" that
               the slaves would have increased from half a million to two millions and
               a half by 1838&#8212;and that the census of 1840 would give to the slave
               states, 30 representatives of "slave property?"

            </p>
            <p>
               If they had "supposed" that this representation would have controlled
               the legislation of the government, and carried against the
               North every question vital to its interests, would Alexander Hamilton,
               Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, Elbridge Gerry, William
               Livingston, John Langdon, and Rufus King have been such madmen,
               as to sign the constitution, and the Northern States such suicides
               as to ratify it? Every self-preserving instinct would have shrieked
               at such an infatuate immolation. At the adoption of the United
               States constitution, slavery was regarded as a fast waning system.
               This conviction was universal. Washington, Jefferson, Patrick
               Henry, Grayson, St. George Tucker, Madison, Wythe, Pendleton,
               Lee, Blair, Mason, Page, Parker, Edmund Randolph, Iredell, Spaight,
               Ramsey, William Pinckney, Luther Martin, James McHenry, Samuel
               Chase, and nearly all the illustrious names south of the Potomac,
               proclaimed it before the sun, that the days of slavery were beginning
               to be numbered. A reason urged in the convention that formed the
               United States constitution, why the word slave should not be used in

               it, was, that <em>when slavery should cease</em> there might remain upon
               the National Charter no record that it had even been. (See speech of
               Mr. Burrill, of R.I., on the Missouri question.)

            </p>
            <p>
               I now proceed to show by testimony, that at the date of the United
               States constitution, and for several years before and after that
               period, slavery was rapidly on the wane; that the American Revolution
               with the great events preceding accompanying, and following
               it, had wrought an immense and almost universal change in the public
               sentiment of the nation of the subject, powerfully impelling it toward
               the entire abolition of the system&#8212;and that it was the <em>general
                  belief</em> that measures for its abolition throughout the Union, would be
               commenced by the individual States generally before the lapse of many
               years. A great mass of testimony establishing this position is at
               hand and might be presented, but narrow space, little time, the patience
               of readers, and the importance of speedy publication, counsel
               brevity. Let the following proofs suffice. First, a few dates as points
               of observation.

            </p>
            <p>
               The first <em>general</em> Congress met in 1774. The revolutionary war
               commenced in '75. Independence was declared in '76. The articles
               of confederacy were adopted by the thirteen states in '78. Independence
               acknowledged in '83. The convention for forming the U.S.
               constitution was held in '87, the state conventions for considering
               it in '87, and '88. The first Congress under the constitution in '89.

               Dr. Rush, of Pennsylvania, one of the signers of the Declaration
               of Independence, in a letter to the celebrated Granville Sharpe, May
               1, 1773, says: "A spirit of humanity and religion begins to awaken
               in several of the colonies in favor of the poor negroes. The clergy
               begin to bear a public testimony against this violation of the laws of
               nature and christianity. Great events have been brought about by
               small beginnings. <em>Anthony Benezet stood alone a few years ago in
                  opposing negro slavery in Philadelphia</em>, and NOW THREE-FOURTHS OF
               THE PROVINCE AS WELL AS OF THE CITY CRY OUT AGAINST IT."&#8212;(Stuart's

               In the preamble to the act prohibiting the importation of slaves into
               Rhode Island, June 1774, is the following: "Whereas, the inhabitants
               of America are generally engaged in the preservation of their own
               rights and liberties, among which that of personal freedom must be
               considered the greatest, and as those who are desirous of enjoying all
               the advantages of liberty themselves, <em>should be willing to extend
                  personal liberty to others</em>, therefore," &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               October 20, 1774, the Continental Congress passed the following:
               "We, for ourselves and the inhabitants of the several colonies whom
               we represent, <em>firmly agree and associate under the sacred ties of
                  virtue, honor, and love of our country</em>, as follows:

            </p>
            <p>
               "2d Article. <em>We will neither import nor purchase any slaves
                  imported</em> after the first day of December next, after which time we will
               <em>wholly discontinue</em> the slave trade, and we will neither be
               concerned

               in it ourselves, nor will we hire our vessels, nor sell our commodities
               or manufactures to those who are concerned in it."

            </p>
            <p>
               The Continental Congress, in 1775, setting forth the causes and
               the necessity for taking up arms, say: "<em>If it were possible</em> for
               men who exercise their reason to believe that the Divine Author of our
               existence intended a part of the human race <em>to hold an absolute
                  property in</em>, and <em>unbounded power over others</em>, marked out
               by infinite goodness and wisdom as objects of a legal domination, never
               rightfully resistible, however severe and oppressive, the inhabitants of these
               colonies might at least require from the Parliament of Great Britain some
               evidence that this dreadful authority over them has been granted to
               that body."

            </p>
            <p>
               In 1776, the celebrated Dr. Hopkins, then at the head of New England
               divines, published a pamphlet entitled, "An Address to the
               owners of negro slaves in the American colonies," from which the following
               is an extract: "The conviction of the unjustifiableness of this
               practice (slavery) has been <em>increasing</em>, and <em>greatly
                  spreading of late</em>, and <em>many</em> who have had slaves, have
               found themselves so unable to justify their own conduct in holding them in
               bondage, as to be induced to <em>set them at liberty</em>. May this
               conviction soon reach every owner of slaves in <em>North America!</em>
               Slavery is, <em>in every instance</em>, wrong,
               unrighteous, and oppressive&#8212;a very great and crying
               sin&#8212;<em>there being nothing of the kind equal to it on the face
                  of the earth.</em>"

            </p>
            <p>
               The same year the American Congress issued a solemn MANIFESTO
               to the world. These were its first words: "We hold these truths to
               be self-evident, that <em>all</em> men are created equal, that they are
               endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these
               are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." <em>Once</em>, these
               were words of power; <em>now</em>, "a rhetorical flourish."

            </p>
            <p>
               The celebrated Patrick Henry of Virginia, in a letter, of Jan. 18,
               1773, to Robert Pleasants, afterwards president of the Virginia Abolition
               Society, says: "Believe me, I shall honor the Quakers for their
               noble efforts to abolish slavery. It is a debt we owe to the purity of
               our religion to show that it is at variance with that law that warrants
               slavery. I exhort you to persevere in so worthy a resolution."

            </p>
            <p>
               In 1779, the Continental Congress ordered a pamphlet to be published,
               entitled, "Observations on the American Revolution," from
               which the following is an extract: "The great principle (of government)
               is and ever will remain in force, <em>that men are by nature free</em>;
               as accountable to him that made them, they must be so; and so long
               as we have any idea of divine <em>justice</em>, we must associate that of
               <em>human freedom</em>. Whether men can part with their liberty, is among
               the questions which have exercised the ablest writers; but it is
               <em>conceded on all hands, that the right to be free</em> CAN NEVER BE
               ALIENATED&#8212;still less is it practicable for one generation to mortgage
               the privileges of another."

            </p>
            <p>
               Extract from the Pennsylvania act for the Abolition of Slavery,
               passed March 1, 1780:  *  *  *  "We conceive that it is our duty,
               and we rejoice that it is in our power, to extend a portion of that freedom
               to others which has been extended to us. Weaned by a long
               course of experience from those narrow prejudices and partialities we
               have imbibed, we find our hearts enlarged with kindness and benevolence
               towards men of all conditions and nations:  *  *  *  Therefore
               be it enacted, that no child born hereafter be a slave," &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia, written just before the close of
               the Revolutionary War, says: "I think a change already perceptible
               since the origin of the present revolution. The spirit of the master is
               abating, that of the slave is rising from the dust, his condition mollifying,
               <em>the way I hope preparing under the auspices of heaven</em>, FOR A
               TOTAL EMANCIPATION, and that this is disposed, in the order of events, to
               be with the consent of the masters, rather than by their extirpation."

            </p>
            <p>
               In a letter to Dr. Price, of London, who had just published a
               pamphlet in favor of the abolition of slavery, Mr. Jefferson, then Minister
               at Paris, (August 7, 1785,) says: "From the mouth to the head of the
               Chesapeake, <em>the bulk of the people will approve of your pamphlet
                  in theory</em>, and it will find a respectable minority ready to
               <em>adopt it in practice</em>&#8212;a minority which, for weight and
               worth of character, <em>preponderates against the greater number</em>."
               Speaking of Virginia, he says: "This is the next state to which we may turn
               our eyes for the interesting spectacle of justice in conflict with avarice and
               oppression,&#8212;a conflict in which THE SACRED SIDE IS GAINING DAILY
               RECRUITS. Be not, therefore discouraged&#8212;what you have written will do
               a <em>great deal of good</em>; and could you still trouble yourself with
               our welfare, no man is more able to give aid to the laboring side. The College
               of William and Mary, in Williamsburg, since the remodelling of its plan,
               is the place where are collected together all the young men of Virginia,
               under preparation for public life. They are there under the direction
               (most of them) of a Mr. Wythe, one of the most virtuous of characters,
               and <em>whose sentiments on the subject of slavery are unequivocal</em>.
               I am satisfied, if you could resolve to address an exhortation to those
               young men with all the eloquence of which you are master that <em>its
                  influence on the future decision of this important question would be great,
                  perhaps decisive</em>. Thus, you see, that so far from thinking you have
               cause to repent of what you have done, <em>I wish you to do more, and wish
                  it on an assurance of its effect</em>."&#8212;Jefferson's Posthumous Works,

               In 1786, John jay, afterward Chief Justice of the United States,
               drafted and signed a petition to the Legislature of New York, on the
               subject of slavery, beginning with these words:

            </p>
            <p>
               "Your memorialists being deeply affected by the situation of those,
               who, although FREE BY THE LAWS OF GOD, are held in slavery by the
               laws of the State," &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               This memorial bore also the signature of the celebrated Alexander
               Hamilton; Robert R. Livingston, afterward Secretary of Foreign

               Affairs of the United States, and Chancellor of the State of
               New York; James Duane, Mayor of the City of New York, and
               many others of the most eminent individuals in the State.

            </p>
            <p>
               In the preamble of an instrument, by which Mr. Jay emancipated
               a slave in 1784, is the following passage:

            </p>
            <p>
               "Whereas, the children of men are by nature equally free, and
               cannot, without injustice, be either reduced to or HELD in slavery."

            </p>
            <p>
               In his letter while Minister at Spain, in 1786, he says, speaking
               of the abolition of slavery: "Till America comes into this measure,
               her prayers to heaven will be IMPIOUS. This is a strong expression,
               but it is just. I believe God governs the world; and I believe it to
               be a maxim in his, as in our court, that those who ask for equity
               <em>ought to do it</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               In 1785, the New York Manumission Society was formed.
               John Jay was chosen its first President, and held the office five
               years. Alexander Hamilton was its second President,
               and after holding the office one year, resigned upon his removal to
               Philadelphia as Secretary of the United States' Treasury. In 1787, the
               Pennsylvania Abolition Society was formed. Benjamin Franklin, warm from
               the discussions of the convention that formed the United States constitution,
               was chosen President, and Benjamin Rush, Secretary&#8212;both signers of the
               Declaration of Independence. In 1789, the Maryland Abolition Society was
               formed. Among its officers were Samuel Chace, Judge of the United States
               Supreme Court, and Luther Martin, a member of the convention that formed the
               United States constitution. In 1790, the Connecticut Abolition Society was
               formed. The first President was Rev. Dr. Stiles, President of Yale College,
               and the Secretary, Simeon Baldwin, (the late Judge Baldwin of New
               Haven.) In 1791, this Society sent a memorial to Congress, from
               which the following is an extract:

            </p>
            <p>
               "From a sober conviction of the unrighteousness of slavery, your
               petitioners have long beheld, with grief, our fellow men doomed to
               perpetual bondage, in a country which boasts of her freedom. Your
               petitioners are fully of opinion, that calm reflection will at last convince
               the world, that the whole system of African slavery is unjust
               in its nature&#8212;impolitic in its principles&#8212;and, in its
               consequences, ruinous to the industry and enterprise of the citizens of these
               States. From a conviction of these truths, your petitioners were led, by
               motives, we conceive, of general philanthropy, to associate ourselves
               for the protection and assistance of this unfortunate part of our fellow
               men; and, though this Society has been <em>lately</em> established, it has
               now become <em>generally extensive</em> through this state, and, we fully
               believe, <em>embraces, on this subject, the sentiments of a large majority
                  of its citizens</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               The same year the Virginia Abolition Society was formed. This
               Society, and the Maryland Society, had auxiliaries in different parts
               of those States. Both societies sent up memorials to Congress. The
               memorial of the Virginia Society is headed&#8212;"The memorial of the
               <em>Virginia Society</em>, for promoting the Abolition of Slavery,
               &amp;c." The following is an extract:

            </p>
            <p>
               "Your memorialists, fully believing that 'righteousness exalteth
               a nation,' and that slavery is not only an odious degradation, but an
               <em>outrageous violation of one of the most essential rights of human
                  nature, and utterly repugnant to the precepts of the gospel</em>, which
               breathes 'peace on earth, good will to men;' lament that a practice, so
               inconsistent with true policy and the inalienable rights of men, should
               subsist in so enlightened an age, and among a people professing, that
               all mankind are, by nature, equally entitled to freedom."

            </p>
            <p>
               About the same time a Society was formed in New-Jersey. It
               had an acting committee of five members in each county in the State.
               The following is an extract from the preamble to its constitution:

            </p>
            <p>
               "It is our boast, that we live under a government founded on
               principles of justice and reason, wherein <em>life, liberty</em>, and the
               <em>pursuit of happiness</em>, are recognised as the universal rights of
               men; and whilst we are anxious to preserve these rights to ourselves, and
               transmit them inviolate, to our posterity, we <em>abhor that inconsistent,
                  illiberal, and interested policy, which withholds those rights, from an
                  unfortunate and degraded class of our fellow creatures</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               Among other distinguished individuals who were efficient officers
               of these Abolition Societies, and delegates from their respective state
               societies, at the annual meetings of the American convention for promoting
               the abolition of slavery, were Hon. Uriah Tracy, United
               States' Senator, from Connecticut; Hon. Zephaniah Swift, Chief Justice
               of the same State; Hon. Cesar A. Rodney, Attorney General of
               the United States; Hon. James A. Bayard, United States Senator, from
               Delaware; Governor Bloomfield, of New Jersey; Hon. Wm. Rawle,
               the late venerable head of the Philadelphia bar; Dr. Casper Wistar,
               of Philadelphia; Messrs. Foster and Tillinghast, of Rhode Island;
               Messrs. Ridgeley, Buchanan, and Wilkinson, of Maryland; and
               Messrs. Pleasants, McLean, and Anthony, of Virginia.

            </p>
            <p>
               In July, 1787, the old Congress passed the celebrated ordinance,
               abolishing slavery in the northwestern territory, and declaring that
               it should never thereafter exist there. This ordinance was passed
               while the convention that formed the United States constitution was
               in session. At the first session of Congress under the constitution,
               this ordinance was ratified by a special act. Washington, fresh from
               the discussions of the convention, in which <em>more than forty days had
                  been spent in adjusting the question of slavery, gave it his approval.</em>
               The act passed with only one dissenting voice, (that of Mr. Yates, of
               New-York,) <em>the South equally with the North avowing the fitness and
                  expediency of the measure of general considerations, and indicating
                  thus early the line of national policy, to be pursued by the United
                  States Government on the subject of slavery</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               In the debates in the North Carolina Convention, Mr. Iredell,
               afterward a Judge of the United States' Supreme Court, said,
               "<em>When the entire abolition of slavery takes place</em>, it will be an
               event

               which must be pleasing to every generous mind and every friend
               of human nature." Mr. Galloway said, "I wish to see this abominable
               trade put an end to. I apprehend the clause (touching the slave trade) means
               to <em>bring forward manumission."</em> Luther Martin, of Md., a member
               of the convention that formed the United States constitution, said, "We ought
               to authorize the General Government to make such regulations as shall be
               thought most advantageous for <em>the gradual abolition of slavery,</em>
               and the <em>emancipation of the slaves</em> which are already in the
               States." Judge Wilson, of Pennsylvania, one of the framers of the
               constitution, said, in the Pennsylvania convention of '87, Deb. Pa. Con.
               p. 303, 156: "I consider this (the clause relative to the slave trade) as
               laying the foundation for <em>banishing slavery out of this country</em>.
               It will produce the same kind of gradual change which was produced in
               Pennsylvania; the new states which are to be formed will be under the control
               of Congress in this particular, and <em>slaves will never be
                  introduced</em> among them. It presents us with the pleasing prospect that
               the rights of mankind will be acknowledged and established
               <em>throughout the Union</em>. Yet the lapse of a few years, and Congress
               will have power to <em>exterminate slavery</em> within our borders."
               In the Virginia convention of '87, Mr. Mason, author of the Virginia
               constitution, said, "The augmentation of slaves weakens the States,
               and such a trade is <em>diabolical</em> in itself, and disgraceful to
               mankind. As much as I value a union of all the states, I would not admit the

               <em>unless they agree to a discontinuance of this disgraceful trade.</em>"
               Mr. Tyler opposed with great power the clause prohibiting the abolition
               of the slave trade till 1808, and said, "My earnest desire is, that
               it shall he handed down to posterity that I oppose this wicked clause."
               Mr. Johnson said, "The principle of emancipation <em>has begun since
                  the revolution. Let us do what we will, it will come
                  round.</em>"&#8212;[<em>Deb. Va. Con.</em> p. 463.] Patrick Henry,
               arguing the power of Congress under the United States constitution to abolish
               slavery in the States, said, in the same convention, "Another thing will
               contribute to bring this event (the abolition of slavery) about. Slavery is
               <em>detested.</em> We feel its fatal effects; we deplore it with all the
               pity of humanity."&#8212;[<em>Deb. Va. Con.</em> p. 431.] In the Mass.
               Con. of '88, Judge Dawes said, "Although slavery is not smitten by an
               apoplexy, yet <em>it has received a mortal wound</em>, and will die of
               consumption."&#8212;[<em>Deb. Mass. Con.</em> p. 60.] General Heath
               said that, "Slavery was confined to the States <em>now existing, it could
                  not be extended</em>. By their ordinance, Congress had declared that the new
               States should be republican States, and <em>have no
                  slavery.</em>"&#8212;p. 147.

               In the debate in the first Congress, February 11th and 12th, 1789,
               on the petitions of the Society of Friends, and the Pennsylvania Abolition
               Society, Mr. Parker, of Virginia, said, "I hope, Mr. Speaker, the
               petition of these respectable people will be attended to <em>with all the
                  readiness the importance of its object demands</em>; and I cannot help
               expressing the pleasure I feel in finding <em>so considerable a part</em>
               of the

               community attending to matters of such a momentous concern to the
               <em>future prosperity</em> and happiness of the people of America. I think
               it my duty, as a citizen of the Union, <em>to espouse their cause</em>."

               Mr. Page, of Virginia, (afterward Governor)&#8212;"Was <em>in favor</em>
               of the commitment; he hoped that the designs of the respectable memorialists
               would not be stopped at the threshold, in order to preclude a
               fair discussion of the prayer of the memorial. With respect to the
               alarm that was apprehended, he conjectured there was none; but there
               might be just cause, if the memorial was <em>not</em> taken into
               consideration. He placed himself in the case of a slave, and said, that on
               hearing that Congress had refused to listen to the decent suggestions of a
               respectable part of the community, he should infer, that the general
               government, <em>from which was expected great good would result to</em>
               EVERY CLASS <em>of citizens</em>, had shut their ears against the voice of
               humanity, and he should despair of any alleviation of the miseries he and his
               posterity had in prospect; if any thing could induce him to rebel, it must be
               a stroke like this, impressing on his mind all the horrors of despair.
               But if he was told, that application was made in his behalf, and that
               Congress were willing to hear what could be urged in favor of discouraging
               the practice of importing his fellow-wretches, he would trust in their justice
               and humanity, and <em>wait the decision patiently</em>."

               Mr. Scott, of Pennsylvania: "I cannot, for my part, conceive how
               any person <em>can be said to acquire a property in another</em>; but
               enough of those who reduce men to the state of transferable goods, or use
               them like beasts of burden, who deliver them up as the property or
               patrimony of another man. Let us argue on principles countenanced
               by reason, and becoming humanity. <em>I do not know how far I might

               Mr. Smith, of South Carolina, said, "That on entering into this government,

               states, not knowing the necessity the citizens of the Southern states
               were under to hold this species of property, <em>would, from motives of
                  humanity and benevolence, be led to vote for a general emancipation</em>;
               and had they not seen, that the constitution provided against the effect
               of such a disposition, I may be bold to say, they never would have
               adopted it."

               of the Society of Friends respecting the slave trade, Mr. Parker,
               of Virginia, said, "He hoped Congress would do all that lay in their
               power to <em>restore to human nature its inherent privileges</em>, and if
               possible, wipe off the stigma, which America labored under. The inconsistency
               in our principles, with which we are justly charged <em>should be
                  done away</em>, that we may show by our actions the pure beneficence of

               <em>When this practice comes to be tried, then the sound of liberty will

               Mr. Madison of Virginia,&#8212;"The dictates of humanity, the principles

               to it.  *  *  *  *  *  I conceive the constitution
               in this particular was formed in order that the Government, whilst it

                  some testimony of the sense of America</em>, with respect to the African
               trade.  *  *  *  *  *  It is to be hoped, that by expressing a

               A writer in the "Gazette of the United States," Feb. 20th, 1790,
               (then the government paper,) who opposes the abolition of slavery, and avows
               himself a <em>slaveholder</em>, says, "I have seen in the papers accounts
               of <em>large associations</em>, and applications to Government for
               <em>the abolition of slavery</em>. Religion, humanity, and the generosity
               natural to a free people, are the <em>noble principles which dictate those
                  measures</em>.  SUCH MOTIVES COMMAND RESPECT, AND ARE ABOVE ANY EULOGIUM
               WORDS CAN BESTOW."

            </p>
            <p>
               It is well known, that in the convention that formed the constitution
               of Kentucky in 1780, the effort to prohibit slavery was nearly
               successful. The writer has frequently heard it asserted in Kentucky,
               and has had it from some who were members of that convention, that
               a decided majority of that body would have voted for its exclusion
               but for the great efforts and influence of two large slaveholders&#8212;men
               of commanding talents and sway&#8212;Messrs. Breckenridge and Nicholas.
               The following extract from a speech made in that convention
               by a member of it, Mr. Rice, a native Virginian, is a specimen of
               the <em>free discussion</em> that prevailed on that "delicate subject."
               Said Mr. Rice: "I do a man greater injury, when I deprive him of his
               liberty, than when I deprive him of his property. It is vain for me
               to plead that I have the sanction of law; for this makes the injury
               the greater&#8212;it arms the community against him, and makes his case

               desperate. The owners of such slaves then are <em>licensed robbers</em>,
               and not the just proprietors of what they claim. Freeing them is not
               depriving them of property, but <em>restoring it to the right owner</em>.
               In America, a slave is a standing monument of the tyranny and inconsistency
               of human governments. The master is the enemy of the slave; he <em>has made
                  open war upon him</em>, AND IS DAILY CARRYING IT ON in unremitted efforts.
               Can any one imagine, then, that the slave is indebted to his master, and
               <em>bound to serve him</em>? Whence can the obligation arise? What is it
               founded upon? What is my duty to an enemy that is carrying on war against me?
               I do not deny, but in some circumstances, it is the duty of the slave to
               serve; but it is a duty he owes himself, and not his master."

               President Edwards, the younger, said, in a sermon preached before
               the Connecticut Abolition Society, Sept. 15, 1791: "Thirty years
               ago, scarcely a man in this country thought either the slave trade or
               the slavery of negroes to be wrong; but now how many and able
               advocates in private life, in our legislatures, in Congress, have
               appeared, and have openly and irrefragably pleaded the rights of
               humanity in this as well as other instances? And if we judge of the
               future by the past, <em>within fifty years from this time, it will be as
                  shameful for a man to hold a negro slave, as to be guilty of common
                  robbery or theft</em>."

               In 1794, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian church adopted
               its "Scripture proofs," notes, comments, &amp;c. Among these was the
               following:

            </p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>
                  "1 Tim. i. 10. The law is made for manstealers. This crime
                  among the Jews exposed the perpetrators of it to capital punishment.
                  Exodus xxi. 16. And the apostle here classes them with <em>sinners of
                     the first rank</em>. The word he uses, in its original import comprehends
                  all who are concerned in bringing any of the human race into slavery,
                  or in <em>retaining</em> them in it. <em>Stealers of men</em> are all
                  those who bring off slaves or freemen, and <em>keep</em>, sell, or buy
                  them."

               In 1794, Dr. Rush declared: "Domestic slavery is repugnant to
               the principles of Christianity. It prostrates every benevolent and just
               principle of action in the human heart. It is rebellion against the
               authority of a common Father. It is a practical denial of the extent
               and efficacy of the death of a common Savior. It is an usurpation of
               the prerogative of the great Sovereign of the universe, who has
               solemnly claimed an exclusive property in the souls of men."

               In 1795, Mr. Fiske, then an officer of Dartmouth College, afterward
               a Judge in Tennessee, said, in an oration published that year,
               speaking of slaves: "I steadfastly maintain, that we must bring them
               to <em>an equal standing, in point of privileges, with the whites</em>!
               They must enjoy all the rights belonging to human nature."

            <p>
               When the petition on the abolition of the slave trade was under discussion
               in the Congress of '89, Mr. Brown. of North Carolina, said,
               "The emancipation of the slaves <em>will be effected</em> in time; it
               ought to be a gradual business, but he hoped that Congress would not
               <em>precipitate</em>
               it to the great injury of the southern States." Mr. Hartley, of
               Pennsylvania said, in the sane debate, "<em>He was not a little surprised
                  to hear the cause of slavery advocated in that house.</em>" WASHINGTON,
               in a letter to Sir John Sinclair, says, "There are, in Pennsylvania,
               laws for the gradual abolition of slavery which neither Maryland nor
               Virginia have at present, but which <em>nothing is more certain</em> than
               that they <em>must have</em>, and at a period NOT REMOTE." In 1782,
               Virginia passed her celebrated manumission act. Within nine years from that
               time nearly eleven thousand slaves were voluntarily emancipated by
               their masters. Judge Tucker's "Dissertation on Slavery," p. 72. In
               1787, Maryland passed an act legalizing manumission. Mr. Dorsey,
               of Maryland, in a speech in Congress, December 27th, 1826, speaking
               of manumissions under that act, said, that "<em>The progress of
                  emancipation was astonishing</em>, the State became crowded with a free
               black population."

            </p>
            <p>
               The celebrated William Pinkney, in a speech before the Maryland
               House of Delegates, in 1789, on the emancipation of slaves, said,
               "Sir, by the eternal principles of natural justice, <em>no master in the
                  state has a right to hold his slave in bondage for a single hour</em>.
               I would as soon believe the incoherent tale of a schoolboy, who should
               tell me he had been frightened by a ghost, as that the grant of this
               permission (to emancipate) ought in any degree to alarm us. Are
               we apprehensive that these men will become more dangerous by becoming
               freemen? Are we alarmed, lest by being admitted into the
               enjoyment of civil rights, they will be inspired with a deadly enmity
               against the rights of others? Strange, unaccountable paradox! How
               much more rational would it be, to argue that the natural enemy of
               the privileges of a freeman, is he who is robbed of them himself!
               Dishonorable to the species is the idea that they would ever prove injurious
               to our interests&#8212;released from the shackles of slavery, by the
               justice of government and the bounty of individuals&#8212;the want of fidelity
               and attachment would be next to impossible."

               Hon. James Campbell, in an address before the Pennsylvania Society
               of the Cincinnati, July 4, 1787, said, "Our separation from
               Great Britain has extended the empire of <em>humanity</em>. The time
               <em>is not far distant</em> when our sister states, in imitation of our
               example, <em>shall turn their vassals into freemen.</em>" The Convention
               that formed the United States' constitution being then in session, attended at

               A Baltimore paper of September 8th, 1780, contains the following
               notice of Major General Gates: "A few days ago passed through
               this town the Hon. General Gates and lady. The General, previous
               to leaving Virginia, summoned his numerous family of slaves about
               him, and amidst their tears of affection and gratitude, gave them their
               FREEDOM."

               In 1791 the university of William and Mary, in Virginia, conferred
               upon Granville Sharpe the degree of Doctor of Laws. Sharpe was
               at that time the acknowledged head of British abolitionists. His indefatigable

               exertions, prosecuted for years in the case of Somerset,
               procured that memorable decision in the Court of King's Bench, which
               settled the principle that no slave could be held in England. He was
               most uncompromising in his opposition to slavery, and for twenty
               years previous he had spoken, written, and accomplished more against
               it than any man living.

               that having done so much in this way, <em>a provision had not been made
                  for the gradual abolition of slavery</em>."&#8212;p. 233, 4.

               Mr. Tucker, of Virginia, Judge of the Supreme Court of that state,
               and professor of law in the University of William and Mary,
               addressed a letter to the General Assembly of that state, in 1796, urging
               the abolition of slavery; from which the following is an extract.
               Speaking of the slaves in Virginia, he says: "Should we not, at the
               time of the revolution, have loosed their chains and broken their
               fetters; or if the difficulties and dangers of such an experiment
               prohibited the attempt, during the convulsions of a revolution, is it not
               our duty, <em>to embrace the first moment</em> of constitutional health
               and vigor to effectuate so desirable an object, and to remove from us a
               stigma with which our enemies will never fail to upbraid us, nor
               consciences to reproach us?"

               Mr. Faulkner, in a speech before the Virginia Legislature, Jan.
               20, 1832, said:&#8212;"The idea of a gradual emancipation and removal of
               the slaves from this commonwealth, is coeval with the declaration of our
               independence from the British yoke. It sprung into existence
               during the first session of the General Assembly, subsequent to the
               formation of your republican government. When Virginia stood
               sustained in her legislation by the pure and philosophic intellect of
               Pendleton&#8212;by the patriotism of Mason and Lee&#8212;by the searching
               vigor and sagacity of Wythe, and by the all-embracing, all-comprehensive
               genius of Thomas Jefferson! Sir, it was a committee composed of
               those five illustrious men, who, in 1777, submitted to the general
               assembly of this state, then in session, <em>a plan for the gradual
                  emancipation of the slaves of this commonwealth</em>."

               Hon. Benjamin Watkins Leigh, late United States' senator from
               Virginia, in his letters to the people of Virginia, in 1832, signed
               Appomattox, p. 43, says: "I thought, till very lately, that it was known
               to every body that during the Revolution, <em>and for many years after,
                  the abolition of slavery was a favorite topic with many of our ablest
                  statesmen</em>, who entertained, with respect, all the schemes which
               wisdom or ingenuity could suggest for accomplishing the object.
               Mr. Wythe, to the day of his death, <em>was for a simple abolition,
                  considering the objection to color as founded in prejudice</em>. By degrees,
               all

               projects of the kind were abandoned. Mr. Jefferson <em>retained</em> his
               opinion, and now we have these projects revived."

               Governor Barbour, of Virginia, in his speech in the U.S. Senate,
               on the Missouri question, Jan. 1820, said:&#8212;"We are asked why has
               Virginia <em>changed her policy</em> in reference to slavery? That the
               sentiments <em>of our most distinguished men</em>, for thirty years
               <em>entirely corresponded</em> with the course which the friends of the
               restriction (of slavery in Missouri) now advocated; and that the Virginia
               delegation, one of which was the late President of the United Stance, voted
               for the restriction, (of slavery) in the northwestern territory, and that
               Mr. Jefferson has delineated a gloomy picture of the baneful effects
               of slavery. When it is recollected that the Notes of Mr. Jefferson
               were written during the progress of the revolution, it is no matter of
               surprise that the writer should have imbibed a large portion of that
               enthusiasm which such an occasion was so well calculated to produce.
               As to the consent of the Virginia delegation to the restriction in
               question, whether the result of a disposition to restrain the slave trade
               indirectly, or the influence of that <em>enthusiasm</em> to which I have
               just alluded,  *  *  *  * it is not now important to decide. We have
               witnessed its effects. The liberality of Virginia, or, as the result may
               prove, her folly, which submitted to, or, if you will, PROPOSED
               <em>this measure</em>, (abolition of slavery in the N.W. territory) has
               eventuated in effects which speak a monitory lesson. <em>How is the
                  representation from this quarter on the present question?</em>"

               Mr. Imlay, in his early history of Kentucky, p. 185, says: "We
               have disgraced the fair face of humanity, and trampled upon the sacred
               privileges of man, at the very moment that we were exclaiming
               against the tyranny of your (the English) ministry. But in contending
               for the birthright of freedom, we have learned to feel <em>for the bondage
                  of others</em>, and in the libations we offer to the goddess of liberty,
               we <em>contemplate an emancipation of the slaves of this country</em>, as
               honorable to themselves as it will be glorious to us."

               lay a tax on the importation of slaves, Mr. Clark of Va. said: "He
               was no advocate for a system of slavery." Mr. Marion, of S. Carolina,
               said: "He never had purchased, nor should he ever purchase a
               slave." Mr. Southard said: "Not revenue, but an expression of
               the <em>national sentiment</em> is the principal object." Mr.
               Smilie&#8212;"I rejoice that the word (slave) is not in the Constitution; its
               not being there does honor to the worthies who would not suffer it to become a
               <em>part</em> of it." Mr. Alston, of N. Carolina&#8212;"In two years we
               shall have the power to prohibit the trade altogether. Then this House
               will be UNANIMOUS. No one will object to our exercising our full
               constitutional powers." National Intelligencer, Jany. 24, 1806.

               and sages, who dared and periled all under the burdens, and

            </p>
            <p>
               Some of the points established by the testimony are&#8212;The universal
               expectation that the <em>moral</em> influence of Congress, of state
               legislatures, of seminaries of learning, of churches, of the ministers of
               religion, and of public sentiment widely embodied in abolition societies,
               would be exerted against slavery, calling forth by argument and appeal
               the moral sense of the nation, and creating a power of opinion
               that would abolish the system throughout the union. In a word, that
               free speech and a free press would be wielded against slavery without
               ceasing and without restriction. Full well did the south know, not
               only that the national government would probably legislate against
               slavery wherever the constitution placed it within its reach, but she
               knew also that Congress had already marked out the line of national
               policy to be pursued on the subject&#8212;had committed itself before the
               world to a course of action against slavery, wherever she could move
               upon it without encountering a conflicting jurisdiction&#8212;that the nation
               had established by solemn ordinance memorable precedent for
               subsequent action, by abolishing slavery in the northwest territory,
               and by declaring that it should never thenceforward exist there; and this
               too, as soon as by cession of Virginia and other states, the territory came
               under Congressional control. The south knew also that the sixth article
               in the ordinance prohibiting slavery was first proposed by the largest
               slaveholding state in the confederacy&#8212;that the chairman of the committee
               that reported the ordinance was a slaveholder&#8212;that the ordinance
               was enacted by Congress during the session of the convention
               that formed the United States Constitution&#8212;that the provisions of the
               ordinance were, both while in prospect, and when under discussion,
               matters of universal notoriety and <em>approval</em> with all parties, and
               when finally passed, received the vote <em>of every member of Congress from
                  each of the slaveholding states</em>. The south also had every reason for
               believing that the first Congress under the constitution would
               <em>ratify</em> that ordinance&#8212;as it <em>did</em> unanimously.

               A crowd of reflections, suggest by the preceding testimony,
               press for utterance. The right of petition ravished and trampled by
               its constitutional guardians, and insult and defiance hurled in the faces of
               the SOVEREIGN PEOPLE while calmly remonstrating <em>with their</em>
               SERVANTS for violence committed on the nation's charter and their own dearest
               rights! Add to this "the right of peaceably assembling" violently
               wrested&#8212;the rights of minorities, <em>rights</em> no

               murdered&#8212;free presses cast into the streets and their fragments strewed

               reverence for justice, liberty, <em>rights</em> and all-pervading law,
               where are they?

            </p>
            <p>
               But we turn from these considerations&#8212;though the times on which
               we have fallen, and those towards which we are borne with headlong
               haste, call for their discussion as with the voices of departing
               life&#8212;and proceed to topics relevant to the argument before us.

            </p>
            <p>
               The seventh article of the amendments to the constitution is
               alleged to withhold from Congress the power to abolish slavery in the
               District. "No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property,
               without due process of law." All the slaves in the District have been
               "deprived of liberty" by legislative acts. Now, these legislative acts
               "depriving" them "of liberty," were either "due process of law,"
               or they were <em>not</em>. If they <em>were</em>, then a legislative
               act, taking from the master that "property" which is the identical "liberty"
               previously taken from the slave, would be "due process of law"
               <em>also</em>, and of course a <em>constitutional</em> act; but if the
               legislative acts "depriving" them of "liberty" were <em>not</em> "due
               process of law," then the slaves were deprived of liberty
               <em>unconstitutionally</em>, and these acts are <em>void</em>.
               In that case the <em>constitution emancipates them</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               If the objector reply, by saying that the import of the phrase "due process of
               law," is <em>judicial</em> process solely, it is granted, and
               that fact is our rejoinder; for no slave in the District <em>has</em> been
               deprived of his liberty by "a judicial process," or, in other words, by
               "due process of law;" consequently, upon the objector's own admission,
               every slave in the District has been deprived of liberty
               <em>unconstitutionally</em>, and is therefore <em>free by the
                  constitution</em>. This is asserted only of the slaves under the "exclusive
               legislation" of Congress.

            </p>
            <p>
               The last clause of the article under consideration is quoted for the
               same purpose: "Nor shall private property be taken for public use
               without just compensation." Each of the state constitutions has a
               clause of similar purport. The abolition of slavery in the District by
               Congress, would not, as we shall presently show, violate this clause
               either directly or by implication. Granting for argument's sake, that
               slaves are "private property," and that to emancipate them, would
               be to "take private property" for "public use," the objector admits
               the power of Congress to do <em>this</em>, provided it will do something
               <em>else</em>, that is, <em>pay</em> for them. Thus, instead of
               denying <em>the power</em>, the objector not only admits, but
               <em>affirms</em> it, as the ground of the inference that
               compensation must accompany it. So far from disproving the existence
               of <em>one</em> power, the objector asserts the existence of
               <em>two</em>&#8212;one, the power to take the slaves from their masters,
               the other, the power to take the property of the United States to pay for
               them.

            </p>
            <p>
               If Congress cannot constitutionally impair the right of private
               property, or take it without compensation, it cannot constitutionally,
               <em>legalize</em> the perpetration of such acts, by <em>others</em>,
               nor <em>protect</em> those who commit them. Does the power to rob a man
               of his earnings, rob the

               earner of his <em>right</em> to them? Who has a better right to the
               <em>product</em> than the producer?&#8212;to the <em>interest</em>,
               than the owner of the <em>principal</em>?&#8212;to the hands and arms,
               than he from whose shoulders they swing?&#8212;to the body and soul, than he
               whose they <em>are</em>? Congress not only impairs but annihilates the
               right of private property, while it withholds from the slaves of the District
               their title to <em>themselves</em>. What! Congress powerless to protect a
               man's right to <em>himself</em>, when it can make inviolable the right to
               a <em>dog</em>? But, waving this, I deny that the abolition of slavery in
               the District would violate this clause. What does the clause prohibit? The
               "taking" of "private property" for "public use." Suppose Congress should
               emancipate the slaves in the District, what would it "<em>take</em>?"
               Nothing. What would it <em>hold</em>? Nothing. What would it put to
               "public use?" Nothing. Instead of <em>taking</em> "private property,"
               Congress, by abolishing slavery, would say "private property shall not
               <em>be</em> taken; and those who have been robbed of it already, shall be
               kept out of it no longer; and since every man's right to his own body is
               <em>paramount</em>, he shall be protected in it." True, Congress may not
               arbitrarily take property, <em>as</em> property, from one man and give it
               to another&#8212;and in the abolition of slavery no such thing is done. A
               legislative act changes the <em>condition</em> of the slave&#8212;makes
               him his own <em>proprietor</em> instead of the property of another. It
               determines a question of <em>original right</em> between two classes of
               persons&#8212;doing an act of justice to one, and restraining the other from
               acts of injustice; or, in other words, preventing one from robbing the other,
               by granting to the injured party the protection of just and equitable laws.

            </p>
            <p>
               Congress, by an act of abolition, would change the condition of
               seven thousand "persons" in the District, but would "take" nothing.
               To construe this provision so as to enable the citizens of the District
               to hold as property, and in perpetuity, whatever they please, or to
               hold it as property in all circumstances&#8212;all necessity, public welfare,
               and the will and power of the government to the contrary
               notwithstanding&#8212;is a total perversion of its whole <em>intent</em>.
               The <em>design</em> of the provision, was to throw up a barrier against
               Governmental aggrandizement. The right to "take property" for <em>State
                  uses</em> is one thing;&#8212;the right so to adjust the
               <em>tenures</em> by which property is held, that <em>each may have his
                  own secured to him</em>, is another thing, and clearly within the scope of
               legislation. Besides, if Congress were to "take" the slaves in the District,
               it would be <em>adopting</em>, not abolishing slavery&#8212;becoming a
               slaveholder itself, instead of requiring others to be such no longer. The
               clause in question, prohibits the "taking" of individual property for public
               uses, to be employed or disposed of <em>as</em> property for governmental
               purposes. Congress, by abolishing slavery in the District, would do no such
               thing. It would merely change the <em>condition</em> of that which has
               been recognised as a qualified property by congressional acts, though
               previously declared "persons" by the constitution. More than this is done
               continually by Congress and every other Legislature. Property the most
               absolute and unqualified,

               is annihilated by legislative acts. The embargo and
               non-intercourse act, prostrated at a stroke, a forest of shipping, and sank
               millions of capital. To say nothing of the power of Congress to take
               hundreds of millions from the people by direct taxation, who doubts
               its power to abolish at once the whole tariff system, change the seat
               of Government, arrest the progress of national works, prohibit any
               branch of commerce with the Indian tribes or with foreign nations,
               change the locality of forts, arsenals, magazines, dock yards, &amp;c., to
               abolish the Post Office system, the privilege of patents and copyrights,
               &amp;c. By such acts Congress might, in the exercise of its acknowledged
               powers, annihilate property to an incalculable amount, and
               that without becoming liable to claims for compensation.

            <p>
               Finally, this clause prohibits the taking for public use of
               "<em>property</em>." The constitution of the United States does not
               recognise slaves as "PROPERTY" any where, and it does not recognise them in
               <em>any sense</em> in the District of Columbia. All allusions to them in
               the constitution recognise them as "persons." Every reference to them
               points <em>solely</em> to the element of <em>personality</em>; and
               thus, by the strongest implication, declares that the constitution
               <em>knows</em> them only as "persons," and <em>will</em> not recognise
               them in any other light. If they escape into free States, the constitution
               authorizes their being taken back. But how? Not as the property of an "owner,"
               but as "persons;" and the peculiarity of the expression is a marked
               recognition of their <em>personality</em>&#8212;a refusal to recognise
               them as chattels&#8212;"persons <em>held</em> to service." Are
               <em>oxen "held</em> to service?" That can be affirmed only
               of <em>persons</em>. Again, slaves give political power as "persons." The
               constitution, in settling the principle of representation, requires their
               enumeration in the census. How? As property? Then why not
               include race horses and game cocks? Slaves, like other inhabitants,
               are enumerated as "persons." So by the constitution, the government
               was pledged to non-interference with "the migration or importation
               of such <em>persons</em>" as the States might think proper to admit until
               1808, and authorized the laying of a tax on each "person" so admitted.
               Further, slaves are recognized as "persons" by the exaction of their
               <em>allegiance</em> to the government. For offences against the government
               slaves are tried as <em>persons</em>; as persons they are entitled to
               counsel for their defence, to the rules of evidence, and to "due process of
               the law," and as <em>persons</em> they are punished. True, they are loaded
               with cruel disabilities in courts of law, such as greatly obstruct and often
               inevitably defeat the ends of justice, yet they are still recognised as
               <em>persons</em>. Even in the legislation of Congress, and in the
               diplomacy of the general government, notwithstanding the frequent and wide
               departures from the integrity of the constitution on this subject, slaves are
               not recognised as <em>property</em> without qualification. Congress has
               always refused to grant compensation for slaves killed or taken by the
               enemy, even when these slaves had been impressed into the United
               States' service. In half a score of cases since the last war, Congress
               has rejected such applications for compensation. Besides, both in

               Congressional acts, and in our national diplomacy, slaves and property
               are not used as convertible terms. When mentioned in treaties and
               state papers it is in such a way as to distinguish them from mere property,
               and generally by a recognition of their <em>personality</em>. In the
               invariable recognition of slaves as <em>persons</em>, the United States'
               constitution caught the mantle of the glorious Declaration, and most worthily
               wears it.&#8212;It recognizes all human beings as "men," "persons," and
               thus as "equals." In the original draft of the Declaration, as it
               came from the head of Jefferson, it is alleged that Great Britain had
               "waged a cruel war against <em>human</em> nature itself, violating its
               most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people,
               carrying them into slavery, * * determined to keep up a market where
               MEN should be bought and sold,"&#8212;thus disdaining to make the charter
               of freedom a warrant for the arrest of <em>men</em>, that they might be
               shorn both of liberty and humanity.

               The celebrated Roger Sherman, one of the committee of five appointed
               to draft the Declaration of Independence, and also a member of the
               Convention that formed the United States' Constitution, said, in the first
               Congress after its adoption: "The constitution <em>does not consider these
                  persons</em>, (slaves,) <em>as a species of
                  property</em>."&#8212;[Lloyd's Cong. Reg. v. 1, p. 313.] That the United
               States' Constitution does not make slaves "property," is shown in the fact,
               that no person, either as a citizen of the United States, or by having his
               domicile within the United States' government, can hold slaves. He can hold
               them only by deriving his power from <em>state</em> laws, or from the law
               of Congress, if he hold slaves within the District. But no person resident
               within the United States' jurisdiction, and <em>not</em> within the
               District, nor within a state whose laws support slavery, nor "held to service"
               under the laws of such state or district, having escaped therefrom,
               <em>can be held as a slave</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               Men can hold <i>property</i> under the United States'
               government though residing beyond the bounds of any state, district, or
               territory. An inhabitant of the Wisconsin Territory can hold property there
               under the laws of the United States, but he cannot hold
               <i>slaves</i> there under the United States' laws, nor by
               virtue of the United States' Constitution, nor upon the ground of his United
               States citizenship, nor by having his domicile within the United States
               jurisdiction. The constitution no where recognizes the right to "slave
               property," <em>but merely the fact that the states have jurisdiction each
                  in its own limits, and that there are certain "persons" within their
                  jurisdictions "held to service" by their own laws</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, in the clause under consideration, "private property"
               is not to be taken "without <em>just</em> compensation." "JUST!" If
               justice is to be appealed to in determining the amount of compensation,
               let her determine the <em>grounds</em> also. If it be her province to say
               <em>how much</em> compensation is "just," it is hers to say whether
               <em>any</em> is "just,"&#8212;whether the slave is "just" property
               <em>at all</em>, rather than a "<em>person</em>." Then, if justice
               adjudges the slave to be "private property,"

               it adjudges him to be <em>his own</em> property, since the right to
               one's <em>self</em> is the first right&#8212;the source of all
               others&#8212;the original stock by which they are accumulated&#8212;the
               principal, of which they are the interest. And since the slave's "private
               property" has been "taken," and since "compensation" is impossible&#8212;there
               being no <em>equivalent</em> for one's self&#8212;the least that can be
               done is to restore to him his original private property.

            </p>
            <p>
               Having shown that in abolishing slavery, "property" would not
               be "taken for public use," it may be added that, in those states where
               slavery has been abolished by law, no claim for compensation has
               been allowed. Indeed the manifest absurdity of demanding it, seems
               to have quite forestalled the <em>setting up</em> of such a claim.

            </p>
            <p>
               The abolition of slavery in the District, instead of being a legislative
               anomaly, would proceed upon the principles of every day legislation.
               It has been shown already, that the United States' Constitution
               does not recognize slaves as "property." Yet ordinary legislation is
               full of precedents, showing that even <em>absolute</em> property is in
               many respects wholly subject to legislation. The repeal of the law of
               entailments&#8212;all those acts that control the alienation of property, its
               disposal by will, its passing to heirs by descent, with the question, who
               shall be heirs, and what shall be the rule of distribution among them, or
               whether property shall be transmitted at all by descent, rather than
               escheat to the state&#8212;these, with statutes of limitation, and various
               other classes of legislative acts, serve to illustrate the acknowledged
               scope of the law-making power, even where property <em>is in every sense
                  absolute</em>. Persons whose property is thus affected by public laws,
               receive from the government no compensation for their losses, unless
               the state has been put into possession of the property taken from
               them.

            </p>
            <p>
               The preamble of the United States' Constitution declares it to be
               a fundamental object of the organization of the government "to ESTABLISH
               JUSTICE." Has Congress <em>no power</em> to do that for which
               it was made the <em>depository of power</em>? CANNOT the United States
               Government fulfil the purpose <em>for which it was brought into
                  being</em>?

            </p>
            <p>
               To abolish slavery, is to take from no rightful owner his property;
               but to "<em>establish justice</em>" between two parties. To emancipate
               the slave, is to "<em>establish justice</em>" between him and his
               master&#8212;to throw around the person, character, conscience, liberty, and
               domestic relations of the one, <em>the same law</em> that secures and
               blesses the other. In other words, to prevent by <em>legal restraints</em>
               one class of men from seizing upon another class, and robbing them at pleasure
               of their earnings, their time, their liberty, their kindred, and the very use
               and ownership of their own persons. Finally, to abolish slavery is to proclaim
               and <em>enact</em> that innocence and helplessness&#8212;now
               <em>free plunder</em>&#8212;are entitled to <em>legal protection</em>;
               and that power, avarice, and lust, shall no longer gorge upon their spoils
               under the license, and by the ministrations of <em>law</em>! Congress, by
               possessing "exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever," has a
               <em>general protective power</em> for ALL the inhabitants

               of the District. If it has no power to protect <em>one</em> man, it has
               none to protect another&#8212;none to protect <em>any</em>&#8212;and if it
               <em>can</em> protect <em>one</em> man and is <em>bound</em> to
               protect him, it <em>can</em> protect <em>every</em> man&#8212;all
               men&#8212;and is <em>bound</em> to do it. All admit the power of Congress
               to protect the masters in the District against their slaves. What part of the
               constitution gives the power? The clause so often quoted,&#8212;"power of
               legislation in all cases whatsoever," equally in the "<em>case</em>" of
               defending the blacks against the whites, as in that of defending the whites
               against the blacks. The power is given also by Art. 1, Sec. 8,
               clause 15&#8212;"Congress shall have power to suppress
               insurrections"&#8212;a power to protect, as well blacks against whites, as
               whites against blacks. If the constitution gives power to protect
               <em>one</em> class against the other, it gives power to protect
               <em>either</em> against the other. Suppose the blacks
               in the District should seize the whites, drive them into the fields and
               kitchens, force them to work without pay, flog them, imprison them,
               and sell them at their pleasure, where would Congress find power to
               restrain such acts? Answer; a <em>general</em> power in the clause so
               often cited, and an <em>express</em> one in that cited
               above&#8212;"Congress shall have power, to suppress insurrections." So much
               for a <em>supposed</em> case. Here follows a <em>real</em> one. The
               whites in the District are <em>perpetrating these identical acts</em>
               upon seven thousand blacks daily. That Congress has power to restrain these
               acts in one case, all assert, and in so doing they assert the power "in
               <em>all</em> cases whatsoever." For the grant of power to suppress
               insurrections, is an <em>unconditional</em> grant, not hampered by
               provisos as to the color, shape, size, sex, language, creed, or condition of
               the insurgents. Congress derives its power to suppress this
               <em>actual</em> insurrection, from the same source whence it derived its
               power to suppress the <em>same</em> acts in the case
               <em>supposed</em>. If one case is an insurrection, the other is. The
               <em>acts</em> in both are the same; the <em>actors</em> only are
               different. In the one case, ignorant and degraded&#8212;goaded by the memory
               of the past, stung by the present, and driven to desperation by the fearful
               looking for of wrongs for ever to come. In the other, enlightened into the
               nature of <em>rights</em>, the principles of justice, and the dictates of
               the law of love, unprovoked by wrongs, with cool deliberation, and by system,
               they perpetrate these acts upon those to whom they owe unnumbered obligations
               for <em>whole lives</em> of unrequited service. On which side may
               palliation be pleaded, and which party may most reasonably claim an abatement
               of the rigors of law? If Congress has power to suppress such acts
               <em>at all</em>, it has power to suppress them <em>in</em> all.

            </p>
            <p>
               It has been shown already that <em>allegiance</em> is exacted of the
               slave. Is the government of the United States unable to grant
               <em>protection</em> where it exacts <em>allegiance</em>? It is an
               axiom of the civilized world, and a maxim even with savages, that allegiance
               and protection are reciprocal and correlative. Are principles powerless with
               us which exact homage of barbarians? <em>Protection is the</em>
               CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT <em>of every human being under the exclusive
                  legislation of Congress who has not forfeited it by crime</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               In conclusion, I argue the power of Congress to abolish slavery
               in the District, froth Art. 1, sec. 8, clause 1, of the constitution:
               "Congress shall have power to provide for the common defence and
               the general welfare of the United States." Has the government of
               the United States no power under this grant, to legislate within its
               own exclusive jurisdiction on subjects that vitally affect its interests?
               Suppose the slaves in the District should rise upon their masters, and the
               United States' government, in quelling the insurrection, should kill any
               number of them. Could their masters claim compensation of the government?
               Manifestly not; even though no proof existed that the particular slaves killed
               were insurgents. This was precisely the point at issue between those masters,
               whose slaves were killed by the State troops at the time of the Southampton
               insurrection, and the Virginia Legislature; no evidence was brought to show
               that the slaves killed by the troops were insurgents; yet the Virginia
               Legislature decided that their masters were <em>not entitled
                  to compensation</em>. They proceeded on the sound principle, that a
               government may in self protection destroy the claim of its subjects even to
               that which has been recognised as property by its own acts. If in providing
               for the common defence the United States government, in the case supposed,
               would have power to destroy slaves both as <em>property and persons</em>,
               it surely might stop half-way, destroy them as <em>property</em> while it
               legalized their existence as <em>persons</em>, and thus provided for the
               common defence by giving them a personal and powerful interest in the
               government, and securing their strength for its defence.

            </p>
            <p>
               Like other Legislatures, Congress has power to abate nuisances&#8212;to
               remove or tear down unsafe buildings&#8212;to destroy infected
               cargoes&#8212;to lay injunctions upon manufactories injurious to the public
               health&#8212;and thus to "provide for the common defence and general welfare"
               by destroying individual property, when it puts in jeopardy the public weal.

            </p>
            <p>
               Granting, for argument's sake, that slaves are "property" in the
               District of Columbia&#8212;if Congress has a right to annihilate property
               in the District when the public safety requires it, it may surely annihilate
               its existence <em>as</em> property when public safety requires it,
               especially if it transform into a <em>protection</em> and
               <em>defence</em> that which as <em>property</em> periled the public
               interests. In the District of Columbia there are,
               besides the United States' Capitol, the President's house, the national
               offices, &amp;c. of the Departments of State, Treasury, War, and Navy,
               the General Post-office, and Patent Office. It is also the residence of
               the President, all the highest officers of the government, both houses of
               Congress, and all the foreign ambassadors. In this same District there
               are also <em>seven thousand slaves</em>. Jefferson, in
               his Notes on Va. p. 241, says of slavery, that "the State permitting
               one half of its citizens to trample on the rights of the other,
               <em>transforms them into enemies</em>;" and Richard
               Henry Lee, in the Va. House of Burgesses in 1758, declared that to
               those who held them, "<em>slaves must be natural
                  enemies.</em>" Is Congress so <em>impotent</em> that it
               <em>cannot</em>
               exercise that right pronounced both by municipal and national law,
               the most sacred and universal&#8212;the right of self-preservation and
               defence? Is it shut up to the <em>necessity</em> of keeping seven thousand
               "enemies" in the heart of the nation's citadel? Does the iron fiat of
               the constitution doom it to such imbecility that it <em>cannot</em>
               arrest the process that <em>made</em> them "enemies," and still goads to
               deadlier hate by fiery trials, and day by day adds others to their
               number? Is <em>this</em> providing for the common defence and general
               welfare? If to rob men of rights excites their hate, freely to restore them
               and make amends, will win their love.

            </p>
            <p>
               By emancipating the slaves in the District, the government of the
               United States would disband an army of "enemies," and enlist "for
               the common defence and general welfare," a body guard of <em>friends</em>
               seven thousand strong. In the last war, a handful of British soldiers
               sacked Washington city, burned the capitol, the President's house,
               and the national offices and archives; and no marvel, for thousands
               of the inhabitants of the District had been "TRANSFORMED INTO ENEMIES."
               Would <em>they</em> beat back invasion? If the national government
               had exercised its constitutional "power to provide for the common
               defence and to promote the general welfare," by turning those "enemies"
               into friends, then, instead of a hostile ambush lurking in every
               thicket inviting assault, and secret foes in every house paralyzing
               defence, an army of allies would have rallied in the hour of her calamity,
               and shouted defiance from their munitions of rocks; whilst the
               banner of the republic, then trampled in dust, would have floated securely
               over FREEMEN exulting amidst bulwarks of strength.

            <p>
               To show that Congress can abolish slavery in the District, under
               the grant of power "to provide for the common defence and to promote
               the general welfare," I quote an extract from a speech of Mr.
               Madison, of Va., in the first Congress under the constitution, May 13,
               1789. Speaking of the abolition of the slave trade, Mr. Madison
               says: "I should venture to say it is as much for the interests of
               Georgia and South Carolina, as of any state in the union. Every
               addition they receive to their number of slaves tends to <em>weaken</em>
               them, and renders them less capable of self-defence. In case of hostilities
               with foreign nations, they will be the means of <em>inviting</em>
               attack instead of repelling invasion. It is a necessary duty of the general
               government to protect every part of the empire against danger, as well
               <em>internal</em> as external. <em>Every thing, therefore, which tends
                  to increase this danger, though it may be a local affair, yet if it involves
                  national expense or safety, it becomes of concern to every part of the union,
                  and is a proper subject for the consideration of those charged with
                  the general administration of the government.</em>" See Cong. Reg. vol.
               1, p. 310-11.

               POSTSCRIPT

            </h3>
            <p>
               My apology for adding a <i>postscript</i>, to a discussion
               already perhaps too protracted, is the fact that the preceding sheets were in
               the hands of the printer, and all but the concluding pages had gone through
               the press, before the passage of Mr. Calhoun's late resolutions in the Senate
               of the United States. A proceeding so extraordinary,&#8212;if indeed the time
               has not passed when <em>any</em> acts of Congress in derogation of
               freedom and in deference to slavery, can be deemed extraordinary,&#8212;should
               not be suffered to pass in silence at such a crisis as the present; especially
               as the passage of one of the resolutions by a vote of 36 to 8, exhibits a
               shift of position on the part of the South, as sudden as it is unaccountable,
               being nothing less than the surrender of a fortress which until then they had
               defended with the pertinacity of a blind and almost infuriated fatuity. Upon
               the discussions during the pendency of the resolutions, and upon the vote, by
               which they were carried, I
               make no comment, save only to record my exultation in the fact there
               exhibited, that great emergencies are <em>true touchstones</em>, and that
               henceforward, until this question is settled, whoever holds a seat in Congress
               will find upon, and all around him, a pressure strong enough to TEST
               him&#8212;a focal blaze that will find its way through the carefully adjusted
               cloak of fair pretension, and the sevenfold brass of two-faced political
               intrigue, and <em>no</em>-faced <em>non-committalism</em>, piercing
               to the dividing asunder of joints and marrow.
               Be it known to every northern man who aspires to a seat in Congress,
               that hereafter it is the destiny of congressional action on this subject,
               to be a
               MIGHTY REVELATOR&#8212;making secret thoughts public property, and proclaiming
               on the house-tops what is whispered in the ear&#8212;smiting off masks,
               and bursting open sepulchres beautiful outwardly, and heaving up to the sun
               their dead men's bones. To such we say,&#8212;<em>Remember the Missouri
                  Question, and the fate of those who then sold the North, and their own
                  birthright!</em></p>
            <p>
               Passing by the resolutions generally without remark&#8212;the attention
               of the reader is specially solicited to Mr. Clay's substitute for Mr.
               Calhoun's fifth resolution.

            </p>
            <p>
               "Resolved, That when the District of Columbia was ceded by the states
               of Virginia and Maryland to the United States, domestic slavery existed in
               both of these states, including the ceded territory, and that, as it still
               continues in both of them, it could not be abolished within the District
               without a violation of that good faith, which was implied in the cession and
               in the acceptance of the territory; nor, unless compensation were made to the
               proprietors of slaves, without a manifest infringement of an amendment to the
               constitution of the United States; nor without exciting a degree of just
               alarm and apprehension in the states recognising slavery, far transcending
               in mischievous tendency, any possible benefit which could be accomplished
               by the abolition."

            </p>
            <p>
               By voting for this resolution, the south by a simultaneous movement,
               shifted its mode of defence, not so much by taking a position entirely new,
               as by attempting to refortify an old one&#8212;never much trusted in, and
               abandoned mainly long ago, as being unable to hold out against assault however

               unskilfully directed. In the debate on this resolution, though the southern
               members of Congress did not <em>professedly</em> retreat from the ground
               hitherto maintained by them&#8212;that Congress has no power by the
               constitution to abolish slavery in the District&#8212;yet in the main they
               silently drew off from it.

            </p>
            <p>
               The passage of this resolution&#8212;with the vote of every southern senator,
               forms a new era in the discussion of this question.

            </p>
            <p>
               We cannot join in the lamentations of those who bewail it. We hail it,
               and rejoice in it. It was as we would have had it&#8212;offered by a southern
               senator, advocated by southern senators, and on the ground that it "was no
               compromise"&#8212;that it embodied the true southern principle&#8212;that
               "this resolution stood on as high ground as Mr. Calhoun's."&#8212;(Mr.
               Preston)&#8212;"that Mr. Clay's resolution was as strong as Mr.
               Calhoun's"&#8212;(Mr. Rives)&#8212;that "the resolution he (Mr. Calhoun) now
               refused to support, was as strong as his own, and that in supporting it, there
               was no abandonment of principle by the south."&#8212;(Mr. Walker, of
               Mi.)&#8212;further, that it was advocated by the southern senators generally
               as an expression of their views, and as setting the question of slavery in the
               District on its <em>true</em> ground&#8212;that
               finally when the question was taken, every slaveholding senator, including
               Mr. Calhoun himself, voted for the resolution.

            </p>
            <p>
               By passing this resolution, and with such avowals, the south has surrendered
               irrevocably the whole question at issue between them and the
               petitioners for abolition in the District. It has, unwittingly but explicitly,
               conceded the main question argued in the preceding pages.

            </p>
            <p>
               The <em>only</em> ground taken against the right of Congress to abolish
               slavery in the District is, that slavery existed in Maryland and Virginia when
               the cession was made, and "<em>as it still continues in both of them</em>,
               it could not be abolished without a violation of that good faith which was
               implied in the cession," &amp;c. The <em>sole argument</em> is
               <em>not</em> that exclusive <i>sovereignty</i> has no
               power to abolish slavery within its jurisdiction, <em>nor</em> that the
               powers of even <em>ordinary legislation</em> cannot do it,&#8212;nor that
               the clause granting Congress "exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever
               over such District," gives no power to do it; but that the <em>unexpressed
                  expectation</em> of one of the parties that the other would not "in
               <em>all</em> cases" use the power which said party had
               consented <em>might be used "in all cases," prohibits</em> the use of it.
               The only cardinal point in the discussion, is here not only
               <em>yielded</em>, but formally laid
               down by the South as the leading article in their creed on the question of
               Congressional jurisdiction over slavery in the District. The
               <em>sole reason</em> given why Congress should not abolish, and the sole
               evidence that if it did, such abolition would be a violation of "good faith,"
               is that "<em>slavery still continues in those states</em>,"&#8212;thus
               explicitly admitting, that if slavery did <em>not</em>
               "still continue" in those States, Congress <em>could</em> abolish it in
               the District. The same admission is made also in the <em>premises</em>,
               which state that slavery existed in those states <em>at the time of the
                  cession</em>, &amp;c. Admitting that if it had <em>not</em> existed
               there then, but had grown up in the District under <em>United States'
                  laws</em>, Congress might constitutionally abolish it. Or that if the ceded
               parts of those states had been the <em>only</em> parts in which slaves
               were held under their laws, Congress might have abolished in such a
               contingency also. The cession in that case leaving no slaves in those
               states,&#8212;no "good faith," would be "implied" in it, nor any "violated,"
               by an act of abolition. The principle of the resolution makes this further
               admission, that if Maryland and Virginia should at once abolish their slavery,
               Congress might at once abolish it in the District. The principle goes even
               further than this, and <em>requires</em> Congress in such case to abolish
               slavery in the District "by the <em>good faith implied</em> in the cession
               and acceptance of the territory." Since

               according to the spirit and scope of the resolution, this "implied good faith"
               of Maryland and Virginia in making the cession, was that Congress would
               do nothing within the District which should go to counteract the policy, or
               bring into disrepute the "institutions," or call in question the usages, or
               even in any way ruffle the prejudices of those states, or do what
               <em>they</em> might think would unfavorably bear upon their interests;
               <em>themselves</em> of course being the judges.

            </p>
            <p>
               But let us dissect another limb of the resolution. What is to be understood
               by "that good faith which was IMPLIED?" It is of course an admission that
               such a condition was not <em>expressed</em> in the acts of
               cession&#8212;that in their <em>terms</em> there is nothing restricting
               the power of Congress on the subject of slavery in the District&#8212;not
               a <em>word</em> alluding to it, nor one inserted with such an
               <em>intent</em>. This "implied faith," then, rests on no clause or word
               in the United States' Constitution, or in the acts of cession, or in the acts
               of Congress accepting the cession, nor does it rest on any declarations of the
               legislatures of Maryland and Virginia made at the time, or in that generation,
               nor on any <em>act</em> of theirs, nor on any declaration of the
               <em>people</em> of those states, nor on the testimony of
               the Washingtons, Jeffersons, Madisons, Chaces, Martins, and Jennifers, of
               those states and times. The assertion rests <em>on itself alone!</em>
               Mr. Clay and the other senators who voted for the resolution,
               <em>guess</em> that Maryland and Virginia <em>supposed</em> that
               Congress would by no means <em>use</em> the power given
               them by the constitution, except in such ways as would be well pleasing in
               the eyes of those states; especially as one of them was the "Ancient
               Dominion!" And now after the lapse of half a century, this
               <em>assumed expectation</em> of Maryland and Virginia, the existence of
               which is mere matter of conjecture with the 36 senators, is conjured up and
               duly installed upon the judgment-seat of final appeal, before whose nod
               constitutions are to flee away, and with whom, solemn grants of power and
               explicit guaranties are when weighed in the balance, altogether lighter than
               vanity!

            </p>
            <p>
               But let us survey it in another light. Why did Maryland and Virginia
               leave so much to be "<em>implied</em>?" Why did they not in some way
               <em>express</em> what lay so near their hearts? Had their vocabulary run
               so low that a single word could not be eked out for the occasion? Or were
               those states so bashful of a sudden that they dare not speak out and
               tell what they wanted? Or did they take it for granted that Congress
               would always act in the premises according to their wishes, and that too,
               without their <em>making known</em> their wishes? If, as honorable
               senators tell us, Maryland and Virginia did verily travail with such
               abounding <em>faith</em>, why brought they forth no <em>works</em>?

            </p>
            <p>
               It is as true in <em>legislation</em> as in religion, that the only
               <em>evidence</em> of "faith" is <em>works</em>, and that "faith"
               <em>without</em> works is <em>dead</em>, i.e. has no
               power. But here, forsooth, a blind implication with nothing
               <em>expressed</em>, an "implied" <em>faith</em> without works, is
               <em>omnipotent</em>. Mr. Clay is lawyer enough to
               know that even a <em>senatorial hypothesis</em> as to <em>what must
                  have been the understanding</em>
               of Maryland and Virginia about congressional exercise of constitutional
               power, <em>abrogates no grant</em>, and that to plead it in a court of
               law, would be of small service except to jostle "their honors'" gravity! He
               need not be told that the constitution gives Congress "power to exercise
               exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such District." Nor that
               the legislatures of Maryland and Virginia constructed their acts of cession
               with this clause <em>before their eyes</em>, and that both of them
               declared those acts made "in <em>pursuance</em>" of said clause. Those
               states were aware that the United States in their constitution had left
               nothing to be "<em>implied</em>" as to the power of Congress over the
               District;&#8212;an admonition quite sufficient one would

               think to put them on their guard, and induce them to eschew vague implications
               and resort to <em>stipulations</em>. Full well did they know also that
               these were times when, in matters of high import, <em>nothing</em> was
               left to be "implied."
               The colonies were then panting from a twenty years' conflict with
               the mother country, about bills of rights, charters, treaties, constitutions,
               grants, limitations, and <em>acts of cession</em>. The severities of a
               long and terrible discipline had taught them to guard at all points
               <em>legislative grants</em>, that their
               exact import and limit might be self-evident&#8212;leaving no scope for a
               blind "faith," that <em>somehow</em> in the lottery of chances there would
               be no blanks, but making all sure by the use of explicit terms, and wisely
               chosen words, and <em>just enough</em> of them. The Constitution of the
               United States with its amendments, those of the individual states, the
               national treaties, the public documents of the general and state governments
               at that period, show the universal conviction of legislative bodies, that when
               great public interests were at stake, nothing should be left to be "implied."

            </p>
            <p>
               Further: suppose Maryland and Virginia had expressed their "implied
               faith" in <em>words</em>, and embodied it in their acts of cession as a
               proviso, declaring that Congress should not "exercise exclusive legislation
               in <em>all</em> cases whatsoever over the District," but that the "case"
               of <em>slavery</em> should be an exception:
               who does not know that Congress, if it had accepted the cession on those
               terms, would have violated the Constitution; and who that has ever studied
               the free mood of those times in its bearings on slavery&#8212;proofs of which
               are given in scores on the preceding pages&#8212;can for an instant believe
               that the people of the United States would have altered their Constitution for
               the purpose of providing for slavery an inviolable sanctuary; that when driven
               in from its outposts, and everywhere retreating discomfited before the
               march of freedom, it might be received into everlasting habitations on the
               common homestead and hearth-stone of this free republic? Besides, who can
               believe that Virginia made such a condition, or cherished such a purpose,
               when at that very moment, Washington, Jefferson, Wythe, Patrick Henry
               St. George Tucker, and almost all her illustrious men, were advocating the
               abolition of slavery by law. When Washington had said, two years before,
               Maryland and Virginia "must have laws for the gradual abolition of slavery
               and at a period <em>not remote</em>;" and when Jefferson in his letter to
               Price, three years before the cession, had said, speaking of Virginia, "This
               is the next state to which we may turn our eyes for the interesting spectacle
               of justice in conflict with avarice and oppression&#8212;a conflict in which
               THE SACRED SIDE IS GAINING DAILY RECRUITS;" when voluntary emancipations
               on the soil were then progressing at the rate of between one and two thousand
               annually, (See Judge Tucker's "Dissertation on Slavery," p. 73;)
               when the public sentiment of Virginia had undergone, and was undergoing so
               mighty a revolution that the idea of the continuance of slavery as a permanent
               system could not be <em>tolerated</em>, though she then contained about
               half the slaves in the Union. Was this the time to stipulate for the
               <em>perpetuity</em> of slavery under the exclusive legislation of
               Congress? and that too at the <em>same</em> session of Congress
               when <em>every one</em> of her delegation voted for the abolition of
               slavery in the North West Territory; a territory which she had herself ceded
               to Congress, and along with it had surrendered her jurisdiction over many of
               her citizens, inhabitants of that territory, who held slaves there&#8212;and
               whose slaves were emancipated by that act of Congress, in which all her
               delegation with one accord participated?

            </p>
            <p>
               Now in view of the universal belief then prevalent, that slavery in this
               country was doomed to short life, and especially that in Maryland and Virginia
               it would be <em>speedily</em> abolished&#8212;are we to be told that these
               states <em>designed</em>
               to bind Congress <em>never</em> to terminate it? Are we to adopt the
               monstrous conclusion that this was the <em>intent</em> of the Ancient
               Dominion&#8212;thus to <em>bind</em> the United States by an "implied
               faith," and that when the United States <em>accepted</em> the cession,
               she did solemnly thus plight her troth, and that Virginia did then so
               <em>understand</em> it? Verily one would think that honorable
               senators supposed themselves deputed to do our <em>thinking</em> as well
               as our legislation, or rather, that they themselves were absolved from such
               drudgery by virtue of their office!

            </p>
            <p>
               Another absurdity of this dogma about "implied faith" is, that where
               there was no power to exact an <em>express</em> pledge, there was none to
               demand an <em>implied</em> one, and where there was no power to
               <em>give</em> the one, there was none to give the <em>other</em>. We
               have shown already that Congress could not have accepted the cession with
               such a condition. To have signed away a part of its constitutional grant of
               power would have been a <em>breach</em> of the
               Constitution. Further, the Congress which accepted the cession was competent
               to pass a resolution pledging itself not to <em>use all</em> the power
               over the District committed to it by the Constitution. But here its power
               ended. Its resolution would only bind <em>itself</em>. Could it bind the
               <em>next</em> Congress by its authority? Could the members of one Congress
               say to the members of another, because we do not choose to exercise all the
               authority vested in us by the Constitution, therefore you <em>shall</em>
               not? This would have been a prohibition
               to do what the Constitution gives power to do. Each successive Congress
               would still have gone to the Constitution for its power, brushing away in its
               course the cobwebs stretched across its path by the officiousness of an
               impertinent predecessor. Again, the legislatures of Virginia and Maryland,
               had no power to bind Congress, either by an express or an implied pledge,
               never to abolish slavery in the District. Those legislatures had no power
               to bind <em>themselves</em> never to abolish slavery within their own
               territories&#8212;the ceded parts included. Where then would they get power
               to bind <em>another</em> not to do what they had no power to bind
               themselves not to do? If a legislature could not in this respect control the
               successive legislatures of its own State, could it control the successive
               Congresses of the United States?

            </p>
            <p>
               But perhaps we shall be told, that the "implied faith" in the acts of cession
               of Maryland and Virginia was <em>not</em> that Congress should
               <em>never</em> abolish slavery in the District, but that it should not do
               it until <em>they</em> had done it within their bounds! Verily this
               "faith" comes little short of the faith of miracles! "A good rule that works
               both ways." First, Maryland and Virginia have "good faith" that Congress will
               <em>not</em> abolish until <em>they</em> do; and then just as "good
               faith" that Congress <em>will</em> abolish <em>when</em> they do!
               Excellently accommodated! Did those States suppose that Congress would
               legislate over the national domain, the common jurisdiction of
               <em>all</em>, for Maryland and Virginia alone? And who, did they suppose,
               would be judges in the matter?&#8212;themselves merely? or the whole Union?

            </p>
            <p>
               This "good faith implied in the cession" is no longer of doubtful
               interpretation. The principle at the bottom of it, when fairly stated, is
               this:&#8212;That the Government of the United States are bound in "good faith"
               to do in the District of Columbia, without demurring, just what and when,
               Maryland and Virginia do in their own States. In short, that the general
               government is eased of all the burdens of legislation within its exclusive
               jurisdiction, save that of hiring a scrivener to copy off the acts of the
               Maryland and Virginia legislatures as fast as they are passed, and engross
               them, under the title of "Laws of the United States, for the District of
               Columbia!" A slight additional expense would also be incurred in keeping up
               an express between the capitols

               of those States and Washington city, bringing Congress from time to time
               its "<em>instructions</em>" from head quarters&#8212;instructions not to
               be disregarded without a violation of that, "good faith implied in the
               cession," &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               This sets in strong light the advantages of "our glorious Union," if the
               doctrine of Mr. Clay and the thirty-six Senators be orthodox. The people
               of the United States have been permitted to set up at their own expense,
               and on their own territory, two great <em>sounding boards</em> called
               "Senate Chamber" and "Representatives' Hall," for the purpose of sending
               abroad "by authority" <em>national echoes</em> of <em>state</em>
               legislation!&#8212;permitted also to keep in
               their pay a corps of pliant <em>national</em> musicians, with peremptory
               instructions to
               sound on any line of the staff according as Virginia and Maryland may give
               the <em>sovereign</em> key note!

            </p>
            <p>
               Though this may have the seeming of mere raillery, yet an analysis of
               the resolution and of the discussions upon it, will convince every fair mind
               that it is but the legitimate carrying out of the <em>principle</em>
               pervading both. They proceed virtually upon the hypothesis that the will and
               pleasure of Virginia and Maryland are <em>paramount</em> to those of the
               <em>Union</em>. If the main design of setting apart a federal district had
               been originally the accommodation of Maryland, Virginia, and the south, with
               the United States as an <em>agent</em> to consummate the object, there
               could hardly have been higher assumption or louder vaunting. The sole object
               of <em>having</em> such a District was in effect totally perverted in the
               resolution of Mr. Clay, and in the discussions of the entire southern
               delegation, upon its passage. Instead of taking the
               ground, that the benefit of the whole Union was the sole <em>object</em>
               of a federal district, that it was designed to guard and promote the interests
               of <em>all</em> the states, and that it was to be legislated over
               <em>for this end</em>&#8212;the resolution
               proceeds upon an hypothesis <em>totally the reverse</em>. It takes a
               single point of <em>state</em> policy, and exalts it above NATIONAL
               interests, utterly overshadowing
               them; abrogating national <em>rights</em>; making void a clause of the
               Constitution; humbling the general government into a subject&#8212;crouching
               for favors to a superior, and that too <em>on its own exclusive
                  jurisdiction</em>. All the attributes of sovereignty vested in Congress
               by the Constitution it impales upon the point of an alleged
               <em>implication</em>. And this is Mr. Clay's peace-offering, to
               appease the lust of power and the ravenings of state encroachment! A
               "<em>compromise</em>," forsooth! that sinks the general government on
               <em>its own territory</em> into a mere colony, with Virginia and Maryland
               for its "mother country!" It is refreshing to turn from these shallow,
               distorted constructions and servile cringings, to the high bearing of other
               southern men in other times; men, who in their character of legislators and
               lawyers, disdained to accommodate their interpretations of constitutions and
               charters to geographical lines, or to bend them to the purposes of a political
               canvass. In the celebrated case of Cohens vs. the State of Virginia, Hon.
               William Pinkney, late of Baltimore, and Hon. Walter Jones, of Washington city,
               with other eminent constitutional lawyers, prepared an elaborate written
               opinion, from which the following is an extract: "Nor is there any danger
               to be apprehended from allowing to Congressional legislation with regard to
               the District of Columbia, its FULLEST EFFECT. Congress is responsible to
               the States, and to the people for that legislation. It is in truth the
               legislation of the states over a district placed under their control for
               <em>their own benefit</em>, not for that of the District, except as the
               prosperity of the District is involved, and necessary to the
               <em>general advantage</em>."&#8212;[Life of Pinkney, p.  612.]

            </p>
            <p>
               The profound legal opinion, from which this is an extract, was elaborated
               at great length many years since, by a number of the most distinguished

               lawyers in the United States, whose signatures are appended to it.
               It is specific and to the point. It asserts, 1st, that Congressional
               legislation over the District, is "the legislation of the <em>States</em>
               and the <em>people</em>," (not of <em>two</em> states, and a mere
               <em>fraction</em> of the people.) 2d, "Over a District
               placed under <em>their</em> control," i.e. under the control of the
               <em>whole</em> of the States, not under the control of <em>two
                  twenty-sixths</em> of them. 3d, That it was thus
               put under their control "<em>for</em> THEIR OWN <em>benefit</em>," the
               benefit of <em>all</em> the States <em>equally</em>; not to secure
               special benefits to Maryland and Virginia, (or what it might be
               <em>conjectured</em> they would regard as benefits.) 4th, It concludes by
               asserting that the design of this exclusive control of Congress over the
               District was "not for the benefit of the <em>District</em>," except as
               that is <em>connected</em> with, and <em>a means of promoting</em> the
               <em>general</em> advantage. If this is the case with the
               <em>District</em>, which is <em>directly</em> concerned, it is
               pre-eminently so with Maryland and Virginia, who are but
               <em>indirectly</em> interested, and would be but remotely affected by it.
               The argument of Mr. Madison in the Congress of '89, an extract from which has
               been given on a preceding page, lays down the same principle; that though any
               matter "<em>may be a local affair, yet if it involves national</em>
               EXPENSE OR SAFETY, <em>it becomes of concern to every part of the union,
                  and is a proper subject for the consideration of those charged
                  with the general administration of the government</em>." Cong. Reg. vol. 1.
               p. 310, 11.

            </p>
            <p>
               But these are only the initiatory absurdities of this "good faith
               <em>implied</em>." The thirty-six senators aptly illustrate the principle,
               that error not only conflicts with truth, but is generally at issue with
               itself. For if it would be a violation of "good faith" to Maryland and
               Virginia, for Congress to abolish slavery in the District, it would be
               <em>equally</em> a violation for Congress to
               do it <em>with the consent</em>, or even at the earnest and unanimous
               petition of the people of the District: yet for years it has been the southern
               doctrine, that if the people of the District demand of Congress relief in this
               respect, it has power, as their local legislature, to grant it, and by
               abolishing slavery there, carry out the will of the citizens. But now new
               light has broken in! The optics of the thirty-six have pierced the millstone
               with a deeper insight, and discoveries thicken faster than they can be
               telegraphed! Congress has no power, O no, not a modicum, to help the
               slaveholders of the District, however loudly they may clamor for it. The
               southern doctrine, that Congress is to the District a mere local Legislature
               to do its pleasure, is tumbled from the genitive into the vocative! Hard
               fate&#8212;and that too at the hands of those who begat it! The reasonings
               of Messrs. Pinckney, Wise, and Leigh, are now found to be wholly at fault,
               and the chanticleer rhetoric of Messrs. Glascock and Garland stalks
               featherless and crest-fallen. For, Mr. Clay's resolution sweeps by the board
               all those stereotyped common-places, as "Congress a local Legislature,"
               "consent of the District," "bound to consult the wishes of the District,"
               &amp;c. &amp;c., which for the last two sessions of Congress have served to
               eke out scanty supplies. It declares, that <em>as slavery existed in
                  Maryland and Virginia at the time of the cession, and as it still continues
                  in both those states, it could not be abolished in the District without a
                  violation of 'that good faith'</em>, &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               But let us see where this principle of the <em>thirty-six</em> will lead
               us. If "implied faith" to Maryland and Virginia <em>restrains</em>
               Congress from the abolition of slavery in the District, it
               <em>requires</em> Congress to do in the District what those states have
               done within their bounds, i.e., restrain <em>others</em> from abolishing
               it. Upon the same principle Congress is <em>bound</em>, by the doctrine of
               Mr. Clay's resolution, to <em>prohibit emancipation</em> within the
               District. There is no <em>stopping place</em> for this plighted "faith."
               Congress must

               not only refrain from laying violent hands on slavery, <em>itself</em>,
               and see to it that the slaveholders themselves do not, but it is bound to keep
               the system up to the Maryland and Virginia standard of vigor!

            </p>
            <p>
               Again, if the good faith of Congress to Virginia and Maryland requires
               that slavery should exist in the District, while it exists in those states, it
               requires that it should exist there <em>as</em> it exists in those states.
               If to abolish <em>every</em> form of slavery in the District would violate
               good faith, to abolish <em>the</em> form existing in those states, and to
               substitute a totally different one, would also violate it. The Congressional
               "good faith" is to be kept not only with <em>slavery</em>, but with the
               <em>Maryland and Virginia systems</em> of slavery. The faith of those
               states not being in the preservation of <em>a</em> system, but of
               <em>their</em> system; otherwise Congress, instead of
               <em>sustaining</em>, would counteract their policy&#8212;principles
               would be brought into action there conflicting with their system,
               and thus the true spirit of the "implied" pledge would be violated. On
               this principle, so long as slaves are "chattels personal" in Virginia and
               Maryland, Congress could not make them <em>real estate</em>, inseparable
               from the soil, as in Louisiana; nor could it permit slaves to read, nor to
               worship God according to conscience; nor could it grant them trial by jury,
               nor legalize marriage; nor require the master to give sufficient food and
               clothing; nor prohibit the violent sundering of families&#8212;because such
               provisions would conflict with the existing slave laws of Virginia and
               Maryland, and thus violate the "good faith implied," &amp;c. So the principle
               of the resolution binds Congress in all these particulars: 1st. Not to
               abolish slavery in the District <em>until</em> Virginia and Maryland
               abolish. 2d. Not to abolish any <em>part</em> of it that exists in those
               states. 3d. Not to abolish any <em>form</em> or <em>appendage</em>
               of it still existing in those states. 4th. <em>To abolish</em> when they
               do. 5th. To increase or abate its rigor <em>when, how</em>, and
               <em>as</em> the same are modified by those states. In a word,
               Congressional action in the District is to float passively in the wake of
               legislative action on the subject in those states.

            </p>
            <p>
               But here comes a dilemma. Suppose the legislation of those states
               should steer different courses&#8212;then there would be <em>two</em>
               wakes! Can Congress float in both? Yea, verily! Nothing is too hard for it!
               Its obsequiousness equals its "power of legislation in <em>all</em> cases
               whatsoever." It can float <em>up</em> on the Virginia tide, and ebb down
               on the Maryland at the same time. What Maryland does, Congress will do in the
               Maryland part. What Virginia does, Congress will do in the Virginia part.
               Though Congress might not always be able to run at the bidding of both
               <em>at once</em>, especially in different directions, yet if it obeyed
               orders cheerfully, and "kept in its place," according to its "good faith
               implied," impossibilities might not be rigidly exacted. True, we have the
               highest sanction for the maxim that no <em>man</em> can serve two
               masters&#8212;but if "corporations have <em>no</em> souls," analogy would
               absolve Congress on that score, or at most give it only <em>a very small
                  soul</em>&#8212;not large enough to be at all in the way, as an
               <em>exception</em> to the universal rule laid down to the maxim!

            </p>
            <p>
               In following out the absurdities of this "<em>implied</em> good faith," it
               will be seen at once that the doctrine of Mr. Clay's Resolution extends to
               <em>all the subjects</em> of <em>legislation</em> existing in Maryland
               and Virginia, which exist also within the District. Every system,
               "institution," law, and established usage there, is placed beyond
               Congressional control equally with slavery, and by the same "implied faith."
               The abolition of the lottery system in the District as an
               <em>immorality</em>, was a flagrant breach of this "good faith" to
               Maryland and Virginia, as the system "still continued in those states." So
               to abolish imprisonment for debt, and capital punishment, to remodel
               the bank system, the power of corporations, the militia law, laws of

               limitation, &amp;c., in the District, <em>unless Virginia and Maryland took
                  the lead</em>, would violate the "good faith implied in the cession,"
               &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               That in the acts of cession no such "good faith" was "implied by Virginia
               and Maryland" as is claimed in the Resolution, we argue from the
               fact, that in 1781 Virginia ceded to the United States all her northwest
               territory, with the special proviso that her citizens inhabiting that
               territory should "have their <em>possessions</em> and <em>titles</em>
               confirmed to them, and be <em>protected</em> in the enjoyment of their
               <em>rights</em> and liberties." (See Journals of Congress
               vol. 9, p. 63.) The cession was made in the form of a deed, and signed by
               Thomas Jefferson, Samuel Hardy, Arthur Lee, and James Monroe. Many
               of these inhabitants <em>held slaves</em>. Three years after the cession,
               the Virginia delegation in Congress <em>proposed</em> the passage of an
               ordinance which should abolish slavery, in that territory, and declare that it
               should never thereafter exist there. All the members of Congress from Virginia
               and Maryland voted for this ordinance. Suppose some member of Congress
               had during the passage of the ordinance introduced the following
               resolution: "Resolved, That when the northwest territory was ceded
               by Virginia to the United States, domestic slavery existed in that State,
               including the ceded territory, and as it still continues in that State,
               it could not be abolished within the territory without a violation of that
               good faith, which was implied in the cession and in the acceptance of the
               territory." What would have been the indignant response of Grayson, Griffin,
               Madison, and the Lees, in the Congress of '87, to such a resolution, and of
               Carrington, Chairman of the Committee, who reported the ratification of the
               ordinance in the Congress of '89, and of Page and Parker, who with every
               other member of the Virginia delegation supported it?

            </p>
            <p>
               But to enumerate all the absurdities into which the thirty-six Senators
               have plunged themselves, would be to make a quarto inventory. We decline
               the task; and in conclusion, merely add that Mr. Clay in presenting
               this resolution, and each of the thirty-six Senators who voted for it, entered
               on the records of the Senate, and proclaimed to the world, a most unworthy
               accusation against the MILLIONS of American citizens who have during nearly
               half a century petitioned the national legislature to abolish slavery in the
               District of Colombia,&#8212;charging them either with the ignorance or the
               impiety of praying the nation to violate its "PLIGHTED FAITH." The resolution
               virtually indicts at the bar of public opinion, and brands with odium, all the
               Manumission Societies, the <em>first</em> petitioners for the abolition of
               slavery in the District, and for a long time the only ones, petitioning from
               year to year through evil report and good report, still petitioning, by
               individual societies and in their national conventions.

            </p>
            <p>
               But as if it were not enough to table the charge against such men as Benjamin
               Rush, William Rawle, John Sergeant, Robert Vaux, Cadwallader
               Colden, and Peter A. Jay,&#8212;to whom we may add Rufus King, James
               Hillhouse, William Pinkney, Thomas Addis Emmett, Daniel D. Tompkins,
               De Witt Clinton, James Kent, and Daniel Webster, besides eleven hundred
               citizens of the District itself; headed by their Chief Justice and
               judges&#8212;even the sovereign States of Pennsylvania, New-York,
               Massachusetts, and Vermont, whose legislatures have either memorialized
               Congress to abolish slavery in the District, or instructed their Senators to
               move such a measure, must be gravely informed by Messrs. Clay, Norvell, Niles,
               Smith, Pierce, Benton, Black, Tipton, and other honorable Senators, either
               that their perception is so dull, they know not whereof they affirm, or that
               their moral sense is so blunted they can demand without compunction a
               violation of the nation's faith!

            </p>
            <p>
               We have spoken already of the concessions unwittingly made in this

               resolution to the true doctrine of Congressional power over the District.
               For that concession, important as it is, we have small thanks to render.
               That such a resolution, passed with such an <em>intent</em>, and pressing
               at a thousand points on relations and interests vital to the free states,
               should be hailed, as it has been, by a portion of the northern press as a
               "compromise" originating in deference to northern interests, and to be
               received by us as a free-will offering of disinterested benevolence,
               demanding our gratitude to the mover,&#8212;may well cover us with shame. We
               deserve the humiliation and have well earned the mockery. Let it come!

            </p>
            <p>
               If, after having been set up at auction in the public sales-room of the
               nation, and for thirty years, and by each of a score of "compromises,"
               treacherously knocked off to the lowest bidder, and that without money and
               without price, the North, plundered and betrayed, <em>will not</em>, in
               this her accepted time, consider the things that belong to her peace before
               they are hidden from her eyes, then let her eat of the fruit of her own way,
               and be filled with her own devices! Let the shorn and blinded giant grind in
               the prison-house of the Philistines, till taught the folly of intrusting to
               Delilahs the secret and the custody of his strength.

            </p>
            <p>
               Have the free States bound themselves by an oath never to profit by the
               lessons of experience? If lost to <em>reason</em>, are they dead to
               <em>instinct</em> also? Can nothing rouse them to cast about for self
               preservation? And shall a life of tame surrenders be terminated by suicidal
               sacrifice?

            </p>
            <p>
               A "COMPROMISE!" Bitter irony! Is the plucked and hood-winked
               North to be wheedled by the sorcery of another Missouri compromise? A
               compromise in which the South gained all, and the North lost all, and lost it
               for ever. A compromise which embargoed the free laborer of the North and
               West, and clutched at the staff he leaned upon, to turn it into a bludgeon and
               fell him with its stroke. A compromise which wrested from liberty her
               boundless birthright domain, stretching westward to the sunset, while it gave
               to slavery loose reins and a free course, from the Mississippi to the Pacific.

            </p>
            <p>
               The resolution, as it finally passed, is here inserted. The original
               Resolution, as moved by Mr. Clay, was inserted at the head of this postscript
               with the impression that it was the <em>amended</em> form. It will be seen
               however, that it underwent no material modification.

            </p>
            <p>
               "Resolved, That the interference by the citizens of any of the states,
               with the view to the abolition of slavery in the District, is endangering the
               rights and security of the people of the District; and that any act or measure
               of Congress designed to abolish slavery in the District, would be a violation
               of the faith implied in the cessions by the states of Virginia and Maryland,
               a just cause of alarm to the people of the slaveholding states, and
               have a direct and inevitable tendency to disturb and endanger the Union."

               POWER OF CONGRESS
               <br>
               OVER THE
               <br>
               DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

            </h3>
            <p>
               A civilized community presupposes a government of law. If
               that government be a republic, its citizens are the sole <em>sources</em>,
               as well as the <em>subjects</em> of its power. Its constitution is their
               bill of directions to their own agents&#8212;a grant authorizing the exercise
               of certain powers, and prohibiting that of others. In the Constitution of the
               United States, whatever else may be obscure, the clause granting power to
               Congress over the Federal District may well defy misconstruction.
               Art. 1, Sec. 8, Clause 18: "The Congress shall have power to exercise
               exclusive legislation, <em>in all cases whatsoever</em>, over such
               District." Congress may make laws for the District "in all
               <em>cases</em>," not of all <em>kinds</em>; not all <em>laws</em>
               whatsoever, but laws "in all <em>cases</em> whatsoever." The grant
               respects the <em>subjects</em> of legislation, <em>not</em> the moral
               nature of the laws. The law-making power every where is subject to
               <em>moral</em> restrictions, whether limited by constitutions or not. No
               legislature can authorize murder, nor make honesty penal, nor virtue a crime,
               nor exact impossibilities. In these and similar respects, the power of
               Congress is held in check by principles, existing in the nature of
               things, not imposed by the Constitution, but presupposed and assumed
               by it. The power of Congress over the District is restricted only by
               those principles that limit ordinary legislation, and, in some respects,
               it has even wider scope.

            </p>
            <p>
               In common with the legislatures of the States, Congress cannot
               constitutionally pass ex post facto laws in criminal cases, nor suspend
               the writ of habeas corpus, nor pass a bill of attainder, nor abridge the
               freedom of speech and of the press, nor invade the right of the people
               to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, nor enact
               laws respecting an establishment of religion. These are general limitations.
               Congress cannot do these things <em>any where</em>. The exact
               import, therefore, of the clause "in all cases whatsoever," is, <em>on all
                  subjects within the appropriate sphere of legislation</em>. Some
               legislatures are restrained by constitutions, from the exercise of powers
               strictly within the proper sphere of legislation. Congressional power
               over the District has no such restraint. It traverses the whole field
               of legitimate legislation. All the power which any legislature has
               within its own jurisdiction, Congress holds over the District of Columbia.

            </p>
            <p>
               It has been objected that the clause in question respects merely

               police regulations, and that its sole design was to enable Congress to
               protect itself against popular tumults. But if the convention that
               framed the Constitution aimed to provide for a <em>single</em> case only,
               why did they provide for "<em>all</em> cases whatsoever?" Besides, this
               clause was opposed in many of the state conventions, because the grant of
               power was not restricted to police regulations <em>alone</em>. In the
               Virginia Convention, George Mason, the father of the Virginia Constitution,
               Patrick Henry, Mr. Grayson, and others, assailed it on that ground.
               Mr. Mason said, "This clause gives an unlimited authority in every
               possible case within the District. He would willingly give them exclusive
               power as far as respected the police and good government of
               the place, but he would give them no more." Mr. Grayson said, that
               control over the <em>police</em> was all-sufficient, and "that the
               Continental Congress never had an idea of exclusive legislation in all cases."
               Patrick Henry said, "Is it consistent with any principle of prudence
               or good policy, to grant <em>unlimited, unbounded authority?</em>" Mr.
               Madison said in reply: "I did conceive that the clause under consideration
               was one of those parts which would speak its own praise. When
               any power is given, its delegation necessarily involves authority to
               make laws to execute it.... The powers which are found
               necessary to be given, are therefore delegated <em>generally</em>, and
               particular and minute specification is left to the Legislature.... It is
               not within the limits of human capacity to delineate on paper all those
               particular cases and circumstances, in which legislation by the general
               legislature, would be necessary." Governor Randolph said: "Holland
               has no ten miles square, but she has the Hague where the deputies
               of the States assemble. But the influence which it has given the
               province of Holland, to have the seat of government within its territory,
               subject in some respects to its control, has been injurious to the other
               provinces." The wisdom of the convention is therefore manifest in
               granting to Congress exclusive jurisdiction over the place of their session.
               [<em>Deb. Va. Con.</em>, p. 320.] In the forty-third number of the
               "Federalist," Mr. Madison says: "The indispensable necessity of
               <em>complete</em> authority at the seat of government, carries its own
               evidence with it."

            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, that the grant in question is to be interpreted according
               to the obvious import of its <em>terms</em>, is proved by the fact, that
               Virginia proposed an amendment to the United States' Constitution at the time
               of its adoption, providing that this clause "should be so construed as
               to give power only over the <em>police and good government</em> of said
               District," <em>which amendment was rejected.</em></p>
            <p>
               The former part of the clause under consideration, "Congress
               shall have power to exercise <em>exclusive</em> legislation," gives
               <em>sole</em> jurisdiction, and the latter part, "in all cases
               whatsoever," defines the <em>extent</em> of it. Since, then, Congress is
               the <em>sole</em> legislature within the District, and since its power is
               limited only by the checks common to all legislatures, it follows that what
               the law-making power is intrinsically competent to do <em>any</em> where,
               Congress is competent to do in the District of

               Columbia. Having disposed of preliminaries, we proceed to state and
               argue the <em>real question</em> at issue.

            <h3><a name="E5wA_sphere"></a>
               IS THE LAW-MAKING POWER COMPETENT TO
               ABOLISH SLAVERY WHEN NOT RESTRICTED IN THAT
               PARTICULAR BY CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS&#8212;or, IS
               THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY WITHIN THE APPROPRIATE
               SPHERE OF LEGISLATION?

            </h3>
            <p>
               In every government, absolute sovereignty exists <em>somewhere</em>. In
               the United States it exists primarily with the <em>people</em>, and
               <em>ultimate</em> sovereignty <em>always</em> exists with them. In
               each of the States, the legislature possesses a <em>representative</em>
               sovereignty, delegated by the people through the Constitution&#8212;the people
               thus committing to the legislature a portion of their sovereignty, and
               specifying in their constitutions the amount and the conditions of the grant.
               That the <em>people</em> in any state where slavery exists, have the power
               to abolish it, none will deny. If the legislature have not the power, it is
               because <em>the people</em> have reserved it to themselves. Had they
               lodged with the legislature "power to exercise exclusive legislation in all
               cases whatsoever," they would have parted with their sovereignty over the
               legislation of the State, and so far forth the legislature would have become
               <em>the people</em>, clothed with all their functions, and as such
               competent, <em>during the continuance of the grant</em>, to do whatever
               the people might have done before the surrender of their power: consequently,
               they would have the power to abolish slavery. The sovereignty of the District
               of Columbia exists <em>somewhere</em>&#8212;where is it lodged? The
               citizens of the District have no legislature of their own, no representation
               in Congress, and no political power whatever. Maryland and Virginia have
               surrendered to the United States their "full and absolute right and entire
               sovereignty," and the people of the United States have committed to
               Congress by the Constitution, the power to "exercise exclusive legislation
               in all cases whatsoever over such District."

            </p>
            <p>
               Thus, the sovereignty of the District of Columbia, is shown to reside
               solely in the Congress of the United States; and since the power of the
               people of a state to abolish slavery within their own limits, results from
               their entire sovereignty within that state, so the power of Congress to
               abolish slavery in the District, results from its entire
               <em>sovereignty</em> within the District. If it be objected that Congress
               can have no more power over the District, than was held by the legislatures of
               Maryland and Virginia, we ask what clause in the constitution graduates the
               power of Congress by the standard of a state legislature? Was the United
               States' constitution worked into its present shape under the measuring
               line and square of Virginia and Maryland? and is its power to be bevelled
               down till it can run in the grooves of state legislation? There is
               a deal of prating about constitutional power over the District, as though
               Congress were indebted for it to Maryland and Virginia. The powers
               of those states, whether few or many, prodigies or nullities, have nothing
               to do with the question. As well thrust in the powers of the Grand

               Lama to join issue upon, or twist papal bulls into constitutional tether,
               with which to curb congressional action. The Constitution of the
               United States gives power to Congress, and takes it away, and <em>it
                  alone</em>. Maryland and Virginia adopted the Constitution
               <em>before</em> they ceded to the United States the territory of the
               District. By their acts of cession, they abdicated their own sovereignty over
               the District, and thus made room for that provided by the United States'
               constitution, which sovereignty was to commence as soon as a cession of
               territory by states, and its acceptance by Congress, furnished a sphere for
               its exercise. That the abolition of slavery is within the sphere of
               legislation, I argue,

            </p>
            <p>
               2. FROM THE FACT, THAT SLAVERY, AS A LEGAL SYSTEM, IS THE
               CREATURE OF LEGISLATION. The law, by <em>creating</em> slavery, not only
               affirmed its <em>existence</em> to be within the sphere and under the
               control of legislation, but equally, the <em>conditions</em> and
               <em>terms</em> of its existence, and the <em>question</em> whether or
               not it <em>should</em> exist. Of course legislation would not travel
               <em>out</em> of its sphere, in abolishing what is <em>within</em> it,
               and what was recognised to be within it, by its own act. Cannot legislatures
               repeal their own laws? If law can take from a man his rights,
               it can give them back again. If it can say, "your body belongs to
               your neighbor," it can say, "it belongs to <em>yourself</em>." If it can
               annul a man's right to himself, held by express grant from his Maker, and
               can create for another an <em>artificial</em> title to him, can it not
               annul the artificial title, and leave the original owner to hold himself by
               his original title?

            </p>
            <p>
               3. THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED
               WITHIN THE APPROPRIATE SPHERE OF LEGISLATION. Almost every
               civilized nation has abolished slavery by law. The history of legislation
               since the revival of letters, is a record crowded with testimony to
               the universally admitted competency of the law-making power to
               abolish slavery. It is so manifestly an attribute not merely of absolute
               sovereignty, but even of ordinary legislation, that the competency of a
               legislature to exercise it, may well nigh be reckoned among the legal
               axioms of the civilized world. Even the night of the dark ages was
               not dark enough to make this invisible.

            </p>
            <p>
               The Abolition decree of the great council of England was passed
               in 1102. The memorable Irish decree, "that all the English slaves
               in the whole of Ireland, be immediately emancipated and restored to
               their former liberty," was issued in 1171. Slavery in England was
               abolished by a general charter of emancipation in 1381. Passing
               over many instances of the abolition of slavery by law, both during
               the middle ages and since the reformation, we find them multiplying
               as we approach our own times. In 1776 slavery was abolished in
               Prussia by special edict. In St. Domingo, Cayenne, Guadeloupe,
               and Martinique, in 1794, where more than 690,000 slaves were
               emancipated by the French government. In Java, 1811; in Ceylon,
               1815; in Buenos Ayres, 1816; in St. Helena, 1819; in Colombia,
               1821; by the Congress of Chili in 1821; in Cape Colony, 1823;

               in Malacca, 1825; in the southern provinces of Birmah, 1826; in
               Bolivia, 1826; in Peru, Guatemala, and Monte Video, 1828, in
               Jamaica, Barbadoes, Bermudas, Bahamas, the Mauritius, St. Christophers,
               Nevis, the Virgin Islands, Antigua, Montserrat, Dominica, St.
               Vincents, Grenada, Berbice, Tobago, St. Lucia, Trinidad, Honduras,
               Demarara, and the Cape of Good Hope, on the 1st of August, 1834.
               But waving details, suffice it to say, that England, France, Spain,
               Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Prussia, and Germany, have all
               and often given their testimony to the competency of the legislative
               power to abolish slavery. In our own country, the Legislature of
               Pennsylvania passed an act of abolition in 1780, Connecticut, in 1784;
               Rhode Island, 1784; New-York, 1799; New-Jersey, in 1804; Vermont,
               by Constitution, in 1777; Massachusetts, in 1780; and New
               Hampshire, in 1784.

            </p>
            <p>
               When the competency of the law-making power to abolish slavery,
               has thus been recognised every where and for ages, when it has been
               embodied in the highest precedents, and celebrated in the thousand
               jubilees of regenerated liberty, is it an achievement of modern discovery,
               that such a power is a nullity?&#8212;that all these acts of abolition
               are void, and that the millions disenthralled by them, are, either themselves
               or their posterity, still legally in bondage?

            </p>
            <p>
               4. LEGISLATIVE POWER HAS ABOLISHED SLAVERY IN ITS PARTS.
               The law of South Carolina prohibits the working of slaves more than
               fifteen hours in the twenty-four. In other words, it takes from the
               slaveholder his power over nine hours of the slave's time daily; and if
               it can take nine hours it may take twenty-four. The laws of Georgia
               prohibit the working of slaves on the first day of the week; and if
               they can do it for the first, they can for the six following.

            </p>
            <p>
               The law of North Carolina prohibits the "immoderate" correction
               of slaves. If it has power to prohibit immoderate correction, it can
               prohibit <em>moderate</em> correction&#8212;<em>all</em> correction,
               which would be virtual emancipation; for, take from the master the power to
               inflict pain, and he is master no longer. Cease to ply the slave with the
               stimulus of fear; and he is free.

            </p>
            <p>
               The Constitution of Mississippi gives the General Assembly power
               to make laws "to oblige the owners of slaves to <em>treat them with
                  humanity</em>." The Constitution of Missouri has the same clause, and an
               additional one making it the DUTY of the legislature to pass such laws
               as may be necessary to secure the <em>humane</em> treatment of the
               slaves. This grant to those legislatures, empowers them to decide what
               <em>is</em> and what is <em>not</em> "humane treatment." Otherwise it
               gives no "power"&#8212;the clause is mere waste paper, and flouts in the face
               of a befooled legislature. A clause giving power to require "humane treatment"
               covers all the <em>particulars</em> of such treatment&#8212;gives power to
               exact it in <em>all respects&#8212;requiring</em> certain acts, and
               <em>prohibiting</em> others&#8212;maiming, branding, chaining together,
               separating families, floggings for learning the alphabet, for reading the
               Bible, for worshiping God according to conscience&#8212;the legislature has
               power to specify each of

               these acts&#8212;declare that it is not "<em>humane</em> treatment," and
               PROHIBIT it.&#8212;The legislature may also believe that driving men and women
               into the field, and forcing them to work without pay, is not "humane
               treatment," and being Constitutionally bound "to <em>oblige</em>" masters
               to practise "humane treatment"&#8212;they have the power to <em>prohibit
                  such</em> treatment, and are bound to do it.

            </p>
            <p>
               The law of Louisiana makes slaves real estate, prohibiting the
               holder, if he be also a <em>land</em> holder, to separate them from the
               soil.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE5wA_FN1"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE5wA_FN1"></a> If it has power to prohibit the sale
               <em>without</em> the soil, it can prohibit the sale <em>with</em> it;
               and if it can prohibit the <em>sale</em> as property, it can prohibit
               the <em>holding</em> as property. Similar laws exist in the French,
               Spanish, and Portuguese colonies.

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE5wA_FN1"></a><a href="#FootE5wA_FN1">A</a>: Virginia made slaves real estate by a law
               passed in 1705. (<em>Beverly's Hist. of Va</em>., p. 98.) I do not find
               the precise time when this law was repealed, probably when Virginia became the
               chief slave breeder for the cotton-growing and sugar-planting country, and
               made young men and women "from fifteen to twenty-five" the main staple
               production of the State.
            </p>
            <p>
               The law of Louisiana requires the master to give his slaves a certain
               amount of food and clothing. If it can oblige the master to give
               the slave <em>one</em> thing, it can oblige him to give him another: if
               food and clothing, then wages, liberty, his own body.

            </p>
            <p>
               By the laws of Connecticut, slaves may receive and hold property,
               and prosecute suits in their own name as plaintiffs: [This last was also
               the law of Virginia in 1795. See Tucker's "Dissertation on Slavery,"
               p. 73.] There were also laws making marriage contracts legal, in
               certain contingencies, and punishing infringements of them, ["<em>Reeve's
                  Law of Baron and Femme</em>," p. 340-1.] Each of the laws enumerated
               above, does, <em>in principle</em>, abolish slavery; and all of them
               together abolish it in fact. True, not as a <em>whole</em>, and at a
               <em>stroke</em>, nor all in one place; but in its <em>parts</em>, by
               piecemeal, at divers times and places; thus showing that the abolition of
               slavery is within the boundary of legislation.

            </p>
            <p>
               5. THE COMPETENCY OF THE LAW-MAKING POWER TO ABOLISH SLAVERY,
               HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY ALL THE SLAVEHOLDING STATES, EITHER
               DIRECTLY OR BY IMPLICATION. Some States recognize it in their
               <em>Constitutions</em>, by giving the legislature power to emancipate such
               slaves as may "have rendered the state some distinguished service, "and
               others by express prohibitory restrictions. The Constitution of Mississippi,
               Arkansas, and other States, restrict the power of the legislature in this
               respect. Why this express prohibition, if the law-making power
               <em>cannot</em> abolish slavery? A stately farce, indeed, to construct a
               special clause, and with appropriate rites induct it into the Constitution,
               for the express purpose of restricting a nonentity!&#8212;to take from
               the law-making power what it <em>never had</em>, and what
               <em>cannot</em> pertain to it! The legislatures of those States have no
               power to abolish slavery, simply because their Constitutions have expressly
               <em>taken away</em> that power. The people of Arkansas, Mississippi,
               &amp;c., well knew the

               competency of the law-making power to abolish slavery, and hence
               their zeal to <em>restrict</em> it.

            </p>
            <p>
               The slaveholding States have recognised this power in their <em>laws</em>.
               The Virginia Legislature passed a law in 1786 to prevent the further
               importation of Slaves, of which the following is an extract: "And be
               it further enacted that every slave imported into this commonwealth
               contrary to the true intent and meaning of this act, shall upon such
               importation become <em>free</em>." By a law of Virginia, passed Dec. 17,
               1792, a slave brought into the state and kept <em>there a year</em>, was
               <em>free</em>. The Maryland Court of Appeals at the December term 1813
               [case of Stewart <i>vs.</i> Oakes,] decided that a slave
               owned in Maryland, and sent by his master into Virginia to work at different
               periods, making one year in the whole, became <em>free</em>, being
               <em>emancipated</em> by the law of Virginia quoted above. North Carolina
               and Georgia in their acts of cession, transferring to the United States the
               territory now constituting the States of Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi,
               made it a condition of the grant, that the provisions of the ordinance of '87,
               should be secured to the inhabitants <em>with the exception of the sixth
                  article which prohibits slavery</em>; thus conceding, both the competency
               of law to abolish slavery, and the power of Congress to do it, within its
               jurisdiction. (These acts show the prevalent belief at that time, in the
               slaveholding States, that the general government had adopted a line of
               policy aiming at the exclusion of slavery from the entire territory of
               the United States, not included within the original States, and that this
               policy would be pursued unless prevented by specific and formal
               stipulation.)

            </p>
            <p>
               Slaveholding states have asserted this power <em>in their judicial
                  decisions</em>. In numerous cases their highest courts have decided that if
               the legal owner of slaves takes them into those States where slavery has
               been abolished either by law or by the constitution, such removal emancipates
               them, such law or constitution abolishing their slavery. This
               principle is asserted in the decision of the Supreme Court of Louisiana,
               in the case of Lunsford <i>vs.</i> Coquillon, 14 Martin's
               La. Reps. 401. Also by the Supreme Court of Virginia, in the case of Hunter
               <i>vs.</i> Fulcher, 1 Leigh's Reps. 172. The same doctrine
               was laid down by Judge Washington, of the United States Supreme Court, in the
               case of Butler <i>vs.</i> Hopper, Washington's Circuit
               Court Reps. 508. This principle was also decided by the Court of Appeals in
               Kentucky; case of Rankin <i>vs.</i> Lydia, 2 Marshall's
               Reps. 407; see also, Wilson <i>vs.</i> Isbell, 5 Call's
               Reps. 425, Spotts <i>vs.</i> Gillespie, 6 Randolph's Reps.
               566. The State <i>vs.</i> Lasselle, 1 Blackford's Reps.
               60, Marie Louise <i>vs.</i> Mariot, 8 La. Reps. 475. In
               this case, which was tried in 1836, the slave had been taken by her master to
               France and brought back; Judge Mathews, of the Supreme Court of Louisiana,
               decided that "residence for one moment" under the laws of France emancipated
               her.

               6. EMINENT STATESMEN, THEMSELVES SLAVEHOLDERS, HAVE CONCEDED
               THIS POWER. Washington, in a letter to Robert Morris, dated

               April 12, 1786, says: "There is not a man living, who wishes more
               sincerely than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition of slavery;
               but there is only one proper and effectual mode by which it can be
               accomplished, and that is by <em>legislative</em> authority." In a letter
               to Lafayette, dated May 10, 1786, he says: "It (the abolition of slavery)
               certainly might, and assuredly ought to be effected, and that too by
               <em>legislative</em> authority." In a letter to John Fenton Mercer, dated
               Sept. 9, 1786, he says: "It is among my first wishes to see some plan adopted
               by which slavery in this country may be abolished by <em>law</em>." In a
               letter to Sir John Sinclair, he says: "There are in Pennsylvania,
               <em>laws</em> for the gradual abolition of slavery, which neither Maryland
               nor Virginia have at present, but which nothing is more certain than that
               they <em>must have</em>, and at a period not remote." Speaking of
               movements in the Virginia Legislature in 1777, for the passage of a law
               emancipating the slaves, Mr. Jefferson says: "The principles of the amendment
               were agreed on, that is to say, the freedom of all born after a
               certain day; but it was found that the public mind would not bear the
               proposition, yet the day is not far distant, when <em>it must bear and
                  adopt it</em>."&#8212;Jefferson's Memoirs, v. 1, p. 35. It is well known
               that Jefferson, Pendleton, Mason, Wythe and Lee, while acting as a committee
               of the Virginia House of Delegates to revise the State Laws, prepared a plan
               for the gradual emancipation of the slaves by law. These men were
               the great lights of Virginia. Mason, the author of the Virginia Constitution;
               Pendleton, the President of the memorable Virginia Convention
               in 1787, and President of the Virginia Court of Appeals;
               Wythe was the Blackstone of the Virginia bench, for a quarter of a
               century Chancellor of the State, the professor of law in the University
               of William and Mary, and the preceptor of Jefferson, Madison, and
               Chief Justice Marshall. He was author of the celebrated remonstrance
               to the English House of Commons on the subject of the stamp act. As
               to Jefferson, his <em>name</em> is his biography.

            </p>
            <p>
               Every slaveholding member of Congress from the States of Maryland,
               Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, voted for the
               celebrated ordinance of 1787, which <em>abolished</em> the slavery then
               existing in the Northwest Territory. Patrick Henry, in his well known letter
               to Robert Pleasants, of Virginia, January 18, 1773, says: "I believe
               a time will come when an opportunity will be offered to <em>abolish</em>
               this lamentable evil." William Pinkney, of Maryland, advocated the abolition
               of slavery by law, in the legislature of that State, in 1789. Luther
               Martin urged the same measure both in the Federal Convention, and
               in his report to the Legislature of Maryland. In 1796, St. George
               Tucker, of Virginia, professor of law in the University of William and
               Mary, and Judge of the General Court, published an elaborate dissertation
               on slavery, addressed to the General Assembly of the State, and
               urging upon them the abolition of slavery by <em>law</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               John Jay, while New York was yet a slave State, and himself in
               law a slaveholder, said in a letter from Spain, in 1786, "An excellent
               law might be made out of the Pennsylvania one, for the gradual abolition

               of slavery. Were I in your legislature, I would present a bill for the
               purpose, drawn up with great care, and I would never cease moving it till
               it became a law, or I ceased to be a member."

            </p>
            <p>
               Daniel D. Tompkins, in a message to the Legislature of New-York
               January 8, 1812, said: "To devise the means for the gradual and ultimate
               <em>extermination</em> from amongst us of slavery, is a work worthy the
               representatives of a polished and enlightened nation."

            </p>
            <p>
               The Virginia Legislature asserted this power in 1832. At the
               close of a month's debate, the following proceedings were had. I
               extract from an editorial article of the Richmond Whig, of January 26,
               1832.

            </p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>
                  "The report of the Select Committee, adverse to legislation on
                  the subject of Abolition, was in these words: <em>Resolved</em>, as the
                  opinion of this Committee, that it is INEXPEDIENT FOR THE PRESENT, to make
                  any <em>legislative enactments for the abolition of Slavery</em>." This
                  Report Mr. Preston moved to reverse, and thus to declare that it
                  <em>was</em> expedient, <em>now</em>
                  to make legislative enactments for the abolition of slavery. This was
                  meeting the question in its strongest form. It demanded action, and immediate
                  action. On this proposition the vote was 58 to 73. Many of the most decided
                  friends of abolition voted against the amendment; because they thought public
                  opinion not sufficiently prepared for it, and that it might prejudice the
                  cause to move too rapidly. The vote on Mr. Witcher's motion to postpone the
                  whole subject indefinitely, indicates the true state of opinion in the
                  House.&#8212;That was the test question, and was so intended and proclaimed by
                  its mover. That motion was <em>negatived</em>, 71 to 60; showing
                  a majority of 11, who by that vote, declared their belief that "at the proper
                  time, and in the proper mode, Virginia ought to commence a system of
                  gradual abolition."

               </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
               7. THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE ASSERTED THIS
               POWER. The ordinance of '87, declaring that there should be "neither
               slavery nor involuntary servitude," in the North Western territory,
               abolished the slavery then existing there. The Supreme Court of
               Mississippi, in its decision in the case of Harvey vs. Decker, Walker's
               Mi. Reps. 36, declared that the ordinance emancipated the slaves then
               held there. In this decision the question is argued ably and at great
               length. The Supreme Court of La. made the same decision in the
               case of Forsyth vs. Nash, 4 Martin's La. Reps. 395. The same doctrine
               was laid down by Judge Porter, (late United States Senator from
               La.,) in his decision at the March term of the La. Supreme
               Court, 1830, in the case of Merry vs. Chexnaider, 20 Martin's
               Reps. 699.

            </p>
            <p>
               That the ordinance abolished the slavery then existing there is also
               shown by the fact, that persons holding slaves in the territory petitioned for
               the repeal of the article abolishing slavery, assigning
               <em>that</em> as a reason. "The petition of the citizens of Randolph and
               St. Clair counties in the Illinois country, stating that they were in
               possession of slaves, and praying the repeal of that act (the 6th article of
               the ordinance

               of '87) and the passage of a law legalizing slavery there."
               [Am. State papers, Public Lands, v. 1. p. 69.] Congress passed this
               ordinance before the United States Constitution was adopted, when it
               derived all its authority from the articles of Confederation, which conferred
               powers of legislation far more restricted than those conferred on
               Congress over the District and Territories by the United States Constitution.
               Now, we ask, how does the Constitution <em>abridge</em> the powers
               which Congress possessed under the articles of confederation?

            </p>
            <p>
               The abolition of the slave trade by Congress, in 1808, is another
               illustration of the competency of legislative power to abolish slavery.
               The African slave trade has become such a mere <em>technic</em>, in common
               parlance, that the fact of its being <em>proper slavery</em> is
               overlooked. The buying and selling, the transportation, and the horrors of the
               middle passage, were mere <em>incidents</em> of the slavery in which the
               victims were held. Let things be called by their own names. When Congress
               abolished the African slave trade, it abolished SLAVERY&#8212;supreme
               slavery&#8212;power frantic with license, trampling a whole hemisphere
               scathed with its fires, and running down with blood. True, Congress
               did not, in the abolition of the slave trade, abolish <em>all</em> the
               slavery within its jurisdiction, but it did abolish all the slavery in
               <em>one</em> part of its jurisdiction. What has rifled it of power to
               abolish slavery in <em>another</em> part of its jurisdiction, especially
               in that part where it has "exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever?"

            </p>
            <p>
               8. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES RECOGNISES THIS
               POWER BY THE MOST CONCLUSIVE IMPLICATION. In Art. 1, sec. 3, clause
               1, it prohibits the abolition of the slave trade previous to 1808: thus
               implying the power of Congress to do it at once, but for the restriction;
               and its power to do it <em>unconditionally</em>, when that restriction
               ceased. Again; In Art. 4, sec. 2, "No person held to service or labor in one
               state under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence
               of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from said service or
               labor." This clause was inserted, as all admit, to prevent the runaway
               slave from being emancipated by the <em>laws</em> of the free states.
               If these laws had <em>no power</em> to emancipate, why this constitutional
               guard to prevent it?

            </p>
            <p>
               The insertion of the clause, was the testimony of the eminent jurists
               that framed the Constitution, to the existence of the <em>power</em>, and
               their public proclamation, that the abolition of slavery was within the
               appropriate sphere of legislation. The right of the owner to that which
               is rightfully property, is founded on a principle of <em>universal
                  law</em>, and is recognised and protected by all civilized nations; property
               in slaves is, by general consent, an <em>exception</em>; hence
               slaveholders insisted upon the insertion of this clause in the United States
               Constitution, that they might secure by an <em>express provision</em>,
               that from which protection is withheld, by the acknowledged principles of
               universal law.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE5wA_FN2"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE5wA_FN2"></a> By demanding

               this provision, slaveholders consented that their slaves should
               not be recognised as property by the United States Constitution, and
               hence they found their claim, on the fact of their being
               "<i>persons</i>, and <i>held</i> to
               service."

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE5wA_FN2"></a><a href="#FootE5wA_FN2">A</a>: The fact, that under the articles of
               Confederation, slaveholders, whose slaves had escaped into free states, had
               no legal power to force them back,&#8212;that <em>now</em> they have no
               power to recover, by process of law, their slaves who escape
               to Canada, the South American States, or to Europe&#8212;the case already
               cited, in which the Supreme Court of Louisiana decided, that residence
               "<em>for one moment</em>," under the laws of France emancipated an
               American slave&#8212;the case of Fulton <i>vs.</i>. Lewis,
               3 Har. and John's Reps., 56, where the slave of a St. Domingo slaveholder, who
               brought him to Maryland in '93, was pronounced free by the Maryland Court of
               Appeals&#8212;are illustrations of the acknowledged truth here asserted, that
               by the consent of the civilized world, and on the principles
               of universal law, slaves are not "<i>property</i>," and
               that whenever held as property under <i>law</i>, it is
               only by <i>positive legislative acts</i>, forcibly
               setting aside the law of nature, the common law, and the principles of
               universal justice and right between man and man,&#8212;principles paramount
               to all law, and from which alone law, derives its intrinsic authoritative
               sanction.
            </p>
            <p>
               9. CONGRESS HAS UNQUESTIONABLE POWER TO ADOPT THE COMMON
               LAW, AS THE LEGAL SYSTEM, WITHIN ITS EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION.&#8212;This has
               been done, with certain restrictions, in most of the States,
               either by legislative acts or by constitutional implication. THE COMMON
               LAW KNOWS NO SLAVES. Its principles annihilate slavery wherever
               they touch it. It is a universal, unconditional, abolition act.
               Wherever slavery is a legal system, it is so only by
               <i>statute</i> law, and in violation of the common law.
               The declaration of Lord Chief Justice Holt, that, "by the common law, no man
               can have property in another," is an acknowledged axiom, and based upon the
               well known common law definition of property. "The subjects of dominion
               or property are <i>things</i>, as contra-distinguished
               from <i>persons</i>." Let Congress adopt the common law
               in the District of Columbia, and slavery there is at once abolished. Congress
               may well be at home in common law legislation, for the common law is the grand
               element of the United States Constitution. All its
               <i>fundamental</i> provisions are instinct with its
               spirit; and its existence, principles, and paramount authority, are
               presupposed and assumed throughout the whole. The preamble of the Constitution
               plants the standard of the Common Law immovably in its foreground. "We, the
               people of the United States, in order to ESTABLISH JUSTICE, &amp;c., do ordain
               and establish this Constitution;" thus proclaiming <em>devotion to</em>
               JUSTICE, as the controlling motive in the organization of the Government, and
               its secure establishment the chief object of its aims. By this most solemn
               recognition, the common law, that grand legal embodyment of
               "<em>justice</em>" and fundamental right&#8212;was made the Groundwork of
               the Constitution, and intrenched behind its strongest munitions. The second
               clause of Sec. 9, Art. 1; Sec. 4, Art. 2, and the last clause of Sec. 2,
               Art. 3, with Articles 7, 8, 9, and 13 of the Amendments, are also express
               recognitions of the common law as the presiding Genius of
               the Constitution.

            </p>
            <p>
               By adopting the common law within its exclusive jurisdiction Congress
               would carry out the principles of our glorious Declaration, and
               follow the highest precedents in our national history and jurisprudence.
               It is a political maxim as old as civil legislation, that laws should be
               strictly homogeneous with the principles of the government whose will
               they express, embodying and carrying them out&#8212;being indeed the
               <em>principles themselves</em>, in preceptive form&#8212;representatives
               alike of the nature and the power of the Government&#8212;standing
               illustrations of its genius and spirit, while they proclaim and enforce its
               authority. Who needs be told that slavery makes war upon the principles of the
               Declaration, and the spirit of the Constitution, and that these and the
               principles of the common law gravitate toward each other with irrepressible
               affinities, and mingle into one? The common law came hither with
               our pilgrim fathers; it was their birthright, their panoply, their glory,
               and their song of rejoicing in the house of their pilgrimage. It
               covered them in the day of their calamity, and their trust was under
               the shadow of its wings. From the first settlement of the country, the
               genius of our institutions and our national spirit have claimed it as a
               common possession, and exulted in it with a common pride. A century
               ago, Governor Pownall, one of the most eminent constitutional
               jurists of colonial times, said of the common law, "In all the colonies
               the common law is received as the foundation and main body of their
               law." In the Declaration of Rights, made by the Continental Congress
               at its first session in '74, there was the following resolution:
               "Resolved, That the respective colonies are entitled to the common
               law of England, and especially to the great and inestimable privilege
               of being tried by their peers of the vicinage according to the course
               of that law." Soon after the organization of the general government,
               Chief Justice Ellsworth, in one of his decisions on the bench of
               the United States Supreme Court, said: "The common law of this
               country remains the same as it was before the revolution." Chief
               Justice Marshall, in his decision in the case of Livingston
               <i>vs.</i> Jefferson, said: "When our ancestors migrated
               to America, they brought with them the common law of their native country, so
               far as it was applicable to their new situation, and I do not conceive that
               the revolution in any degree changed the relations of man to man, or the law
               which regulates them. In breaking our political connection with the parent
               state, we did not break our connection with each other." [<em>Hall's
                  Law Journal, new series.</em>] Mr. Duponceau, in his "Dissertation on
               the Jurisdiction of Courts in the United States," says, "I consider
               the common law of England the
               <i>jus commune</i> of the United States.
               I think I can lay it down as a correct principle, that the common
               law of England, as it was at the time of the Declaration of Independence,
               still continues to be the national law of this country,
               so far as it is applicable to our present state, and subject to the
               modifications it has received here in the course of nearly half a
               century." Chief Justice Taylor of North Carolina, in his decision in
               the case of the State <i>vs.</i> Reed, in 1823, Hawkes'
               N.C. Reps. 454,

               says, "a law of <em>paramount obligation to the statute</em>, was
               violated by the offence&#8212;COMMON LAW founded upon the law of nature, and
               confirmed by revelation." The legislation of the United States abounds
               in recognitions of the principles of the common law, asserting their
               paramount binding power. Sparing details, of which our national
               state papers are full, we illustrate by a single instance. It was made
               a condition of the admission of Louisiana into the Union, that the right
               of trial by jury should be secured to all her citizens,&#8212;the United
               States government thus employing its power to enlarge the jurisdiction
               of the common law in this its great representative.

            </p>
            <p>
               Having shown that the abolition of slavery is within the competency
               of the law-making power, when unrestricted by constitutional
               provisions, and that the legislation of Congress over the District is
               thus unrestricted, its power to abolish slavery there is established.

            </p>
            <p>
               We argue it further, from the fact, that slavery exists there <em>now</em>
               by an act of Congress. In the act of 16th July, 1790, Congress accepted
               portions of territory offered by the states of Maryland and Virginia,
               and enacted that the laws, as they then were, should continue in
               force, "until Congress shall otherwise by law provide." Under these
               laws, adopted by Congress, and in effect re-enacted and made laws of
               the District, the slaves there are now held.

            </p>
            <p>
               Is Congress so impotent in its own "exclusive jurisdiction" that it
               <em>cannot</em> "otherwise by law provide?" If it can say, what
               <em>shall</em> be considered property, it can say what shall
               <em>not</em> be considered property. Suppose a legislature should enact
               that marriage contracts shall be mere bills of sale, making a husband the
               proprietor of his wife, as his <i>bona fide</i> property;
               and suppose husbands should herd their wives in droves for the market as
               beasts of burden, or for the brothel as victims of lust, and then prate about
               their inviolable legal property, and deny the power of the legislature, which
               stamped them "property," to undo its own wrong, and secure to wives by law the
               rights of human beings. Would such cant about "legal rights" be heeded where
               reason and justice held sway, and where law, based upon fundamental
               morality, received homage? If a frantic legislature pronounces
               woman a chattel, has it no power, with returning reason, to take
               back the blasphemy? Is the impious edict irrepealable? Be it, that
               with legal forms it has stamped wives "wares." Can no legislation
               blot out the brand? Must the handwriting of Deity on human nature
               be expunged for ever? Has law no power to stay the erasing
               pen, and tear off the scrawled label that covers up the IMAGE OF GOD?

               II. THE POWER OF CONGRESS TO ABOLISH SLAVERY
               IN THE DISTRICT HAS BEEN, TILL RECENTLY, UNIVERSALLY
               CONCEDED.

            </h3>
            <p>
               1. IT HAS BEEN ASSUMED BY CONGRESS ITSELF. The following record
               stands on the journals of the House of Representatives for 1804,
               p. 225: "On motion made and seconded that the House do come to
               the following resolution: 'Resolved, That from and after the 4th day

               of July, 1805, all blacks and people of color that shall be born within
               the District of Columbia, or whose mothers shall be the property of
               any person residing within said District, shall be free, the males at
               the age of ----, and the females at the age of ----. The main question
               being taken that the house do agree to said motion as originally proposed, it
               was negatived by a majority of 46.'" Though the motion was lost, it was on
               the ground of its alleged <em>inexpediency</em> alone. In the debate which
               preceded the vote, the <em>power</em> of Congress was conceded. In March,
               1816, the House of Representatives passed the following
               resolution:&#8212;"Resolved, That a committee be appointed to
               inquire into the existence of an inhuman and illegal traffic in slaves,
               carried on in and through the District of Columbia, and to report
               whether any and what measures are necessary for <em>putting a stop to the
                  same</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               On the 9th of January, 1829, the House of Representatives passed
               the following resolution by a vote of 114 to 66: "Resolved, That the
               Committee on the District of Columbia, be instructed to inquire into
               the <em>expediency</em> of providing by <em>law</em> for the gradual
               abolition of slavery within the District, in such manner that the interests
               of no individual shall be injured thereby." Among those who voted in the
               affirmative were Messrs. Barney of Md., Armstrong of Va., A.H. Shepperd of
               N.C., Blair of Tenn., Chilton and Lyon of Ky., Johns of Del., and
               others from slave states.

            </p>
            <p>
               2. IT HAS BEES CONCEDED BY COMMITTEES OF CONGRESS, OF THE
               DISTRICT of COLUMBIA.&#8212;In a report of the committee on the District,
               Jan. 11, 1837, by their chairman, Mr. Powell of Va., there is the following
               declaration:&#8212;"The Congress of the United States, has by the
               constitution exclusive jurisdiction over the District, and has power
               upon this subject, (<i>slavery</i>,) as upon all other
               subjects of legislation, to exercise <em>unlimited discretion</em>." Reps.
               of Comms. 2d Sess. 19th Cong. v. iv. No. 43. In December, 1831, the committee
               on the District, Dr. Doddridge of Va., Chairman, reported, "That until the
               adjoining states act on the subject, (slavery) it would be (not
               <i>unconstitutional</i> but) unwise and impolitic, if
               not unjust, for Congress to interfere." In April, 1836, a special committee
               on abolition memorials reported the following resolutions by their Chairman,
               Mr. Pinckney of South Carolina: "Resolved, That Congress possesses no
               constitutional authority to interfere in any way with the institution of
               slavery in any of the states of this confederacy."

            </p>
            <p>
               "Resolved, That Congress <em>ought not to interfere</em> in any way with
               slavery in the District of Columbia." "Ought not to interfere," carefully
               avoiding the phraseology of the first resolution, and thus in effect
               conceding the constitutional power. In a widely circulated "Address
               to the electors of the Charleston District," Mr. Pinkney is thus denounced
               by his own constituents: "He has proposed a resolution
               which is received by the plain common sense of the whole country as
               a concession that Congress has authority to abolish slavery in the
               District of Columbia."

            </p>
            <p>
               3. IT HAS BEEN CONCEDED BY THE CITIZENS OF THE DISTRICT. A petition for the
               gradual abolition of slavery in the District, signed by nearly eleven
               hundred of its citizens, was presented to Congress, March 24, 1827. Among the
               signers to this petition, were Chief Justice Cranch, Judge Van Ness,
               Judge Morsel, Prof. J.M. Staughton, and a large number of the most
               influential inhabitants of the District. Mr. Dickson, of New York, asserted
               on the floor of Congress in 1835, that the signers of this petition owned
               more than half of the property in the District. The accuracy of this
               statement has never been questioned.

            </p>
            <p>
               THIS POWER HAS BEEN CONCEDED BY GRAND JURIES OF THE DISTRICT. The Grand
               jury of the county of Alexandria, at the March term, 1802, presented the
               domestic slave trade as a grievance, and said, "We consider these grievances
               demanding <i>legislative</i> redress." Jan. 19, 1829, Mr.
               Alexander, of Virginia, presented a representation of the grand jury in the
               city of Washington, remonstrating against "any measure for the abolition
               of slavery within said District, unless accompanied by measures for the
               removal of the emancipated from the same;" thus, not only conceding the
               power to emancipate slaves, but affirming an additional power, that
               of <em>excluding them when free</em>. Journal H.R. 1828-9, p. 174.

            </p>
            <p>
               4. THIS POWER HAS BEEN CONCEDED BY STATE LEGISLATURES. In 1828 the Legislature
               of Pennsylvania instructed their Senators in Congress "to procure, if
               practicable, the passage of a law to abolish slavery in the District of
               Columbia." Jan. 28, 1829, the House of Assembly of New-York passed a
               resolution, that their "Senators in Congress be instructed to make every
               possible exertion to effect the passage of a law for the abolition of Slavery
               in the District of Columbia." In February, 1837, the Senate of Massachusetts
               "Resolved, That Congress having exclusive legislation in the District of
               Columbia, possess the right to abolish slavery and the slave trade
               therein." The House of Representatives passed the following resolution
               at the same session: "Resolved, That Congress having exclusive legislation
               in the District of Columbia, possess the right to abolish slavery in
               said District."

            </p>
            <p>
               November 1, 1837, the Legislature of Vermont, "Resolved, that Congress have
               the full power by the constitution to abolish slavery and the slave trade
               in the District of Columbia, and in the territories."

            </p>
            <p>
               May 30, 1836, a committee of the Pennsylvania Legislature reported the
               following resolution: "Resolved, That Congress does possess the
               constitutional power, and it is expedient to abolish slavery and the slave
               trade within the District of Columbia."

            </p>
            <p>
               In January, 1836, the Legislature of South Carolina "Resolved, That we
               should consider the abolition of Slavery in the District of Columbia as a
               violation of the rights of the citizens of that District derived from the
               <em>implied</em> conditions on which that territory was
               ceded to the General Government." Instead of denying the constitutional power,
               they virtually admit its existence, by striving to smother it under an
               <em>implication</em>. In February, 1836, the Legislature of North Carolina
               "Resolved, That, although by the Constitution <em>all legislative
                  power</em> over the District of Columbia is vested in the Congress of the
               United States, yet we would deprecate any legislative action on the part of
               that body towards liberating the slaves of that District, as a breach of
               faith towards those States by whom the territory was originally ceded.
               Here is a full concession of the <em>power</em>. February 2, 1836, the
               Virginia Legislature passed unanimously the following resolution: "Resolved,
               by the General Assembly of Virginia, that the following article
               be proposed to the several states of this Union, and to Congress, as an
               amendment of the Constitution of the United States: "The powers of
               Congress shall not be so construed as to authorize the passage of any
               law for the emancipation of slaves in the District of Columbia, without
               the consent of the individual proprietors thereof, unless by the sanction
               of the Legislatures of Virginia and Maryland, and under such conditions
               as they shall by law prescribe."

            </p>
            <p>
               Fifty years after the formation of the United States' constitution the
               states are solemnly called upon by the Virginia Legislature, to amend
               that instrument by a clause asserting that, in the grant to Congress of
               "exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever" over the District, the
               "case" of slavery is not included!! What could have dictated such
               a resolution but the conviction that the power to abolish slavery is an
               irresistible inference from the constitution <em>as it is</em>. The fact
               that the same legislature passed afterward a resolution, though by no
               means unanimously, that Congress does not possess the power, abates
               not a tittle of the testimony in the first resolution. March 23d, 1824,
               "Mr. Brown presented the resolutions of the General Assembly of
               Ohio, recommending to Congress the consideration of a system for
               the gradual emancipation of persons of color held in servitude in
               the United States." On the same day, "Mr. Noble, of Indiana, communicated
               a resolution from the legislature of that state, respecting
               the gradual emancipation of slaves within the United States." Journal
               of the United States Senate, for 1824-5, p. 231.

            </p>
            <p>
               The Ohio and Indiana resolutions, by taking for granted the
               <em>general</em> power of Congress over the subject of slavery, do
               virtually assert its <em>special</em> power within its
               <em>exclusive</em> jurisdiction.

               5. THIS POWER HAS BEEN CONCEDED BY BODIES OF CITIZENS IN
               THE SLAVE STATES. The petition of eleven hundred citizens of the
               District, has been already mentioned. "March 5, 1830, Mr. Washington
               presented a memorial of inhabitants of the county of Frederick,
               in the state of Maryland, praying that provision be made for the
               gradual abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia." Journal
               H.R. 1829-30, p. 358.

            </p>
            <p>
               March 30, 1828. Mr. A.H. Shepperd, of North Carolina, presented
               a memorial of citizens of that state, "praying Congress to
               take measures for the entire abolition of slavery in the District of
               Columbia." Journal H.R. 1829-30, p. 379.

            </p>
            <p>
               January 14, 1822. Mr. Rhea, of Tennessee, presented a memorial

               of citizens of that state, praying "that provision may be made,
               whereby all slaves which may hereafter be born in the District of Columbia,
               shall be free at a certain period of their lives." Journal H.R. 1821-22,
               p. 142.

            </p>
            <p>
               December 13, 1824. Mr. Saunders of North Carolina, presented
               a memorial of citizens of that state, praying "that measures may be
               taken for the gradual abolition of slavery in the United States." Journal
               H.R. 1824-25, p. 27.

            <p>
               December 16, 1828. "Mr. Barnard presented the memorial of
               the American Convention for promoting the abolition of slavery, held
               in Baltimore, praying that slavery may be abolished in the District
               of Columbia." Journal U.S. Senate, 1828-29, p. 24.

               6. DISTINGUISHED STATESMEN AND JURISTS IN THE SLAVEHOLDING
               STATES, HAVE CONCEDED THIS POWER. The testimony of Messrs.
               Doddridge, and Powell, of Virginia, Chief Justice Cranch, and Judges
               Morsel and Van Ness, of the District, has already been given. In
               the debate in Congress on the memorial of the Society of Friends,
               in 1790, Mr. Madison, in speaking of the territories of the United
               States, explicitly declared, from his own knowledge of the views of
               the members of the convention that framed the constitution, as well
               as from the obvious import of its terms, that in the territories, "Congress
               have certainly the power to regulate the subject of slavery."
               Congress can have no more power over the territories than that of
               "exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever," consequently, according
               to Mr. Madison, "it has certainly the power to regulate the subject
               of slavery in the" <em>District</em>. In March, 1816, Mr. Randolph of
               Va. introduced a resolution for putting a stop to the domestic slave
               trade within the District. December 12, 1827, Mr. Barney, of Md.
               presented a memorial for abolition in the District, and moved that it
               be printed. Mr. McDuffie, of S.C., objected to the printing, but "expressly
               admitted the right of Congress to grant to the people of the
               District any measures which they might deem necessary to free themselves
               from the deplorable evil."&#8212;[See letter of Mr. Claiborne of
               Miss. to his constituents, published in the Washington Globe, May 9,
               1836.] The sentiments of Mr. Clay, of Kentucky, on the subject are
               well known. In a speech before the U.S. Senate, in 1836, he declared
               the power of Congress to abolish slavery in the District "unquestionable."
               Messrs. Blair, of Tenn., and Chilton, Lyon, and
               R.M. Johnson, of Ky., A.H. Shepperd, of N.C., Messrs. Armstrong
               and Smyth, of Va., Messrs. Dorsey, Archer, and Barney, of Md., and
               Johns, of Del., with numerous others from slave states, have asserted
               the power of Congress to abolish slavery in the District. In the
               speech of Mr. Smyth, of Va., on the Missouri question, January 28,
               1820, he says on this point: "If the future freedom of the blacks is
               your real object, and not a mere pretence, why do you not begin
               <em>here</em>? Within the ten miles square, you have
               <em>undoubted power</em> to exercise exclusive legislation.
               <em>Produce a bill to emancipate the slaves in the District of
                  Columbia</em>, or, if you prefer it, to emancipate those born
               hereafter."

            </p>
            <p>
               To this may be added the testimony of the present Vice President
               of the United States, Hon. Richard M. Johnson, of Kentucky.
               In a speech before the U.S. Senate, Feb. 1, 1820, (National Intelligencer,
               April 20, 1820) he says: "In the District of Columbia,
               containing a population of 30,000 souls, and probably as many slaves
               as the whole territory of Missouri, THE POWER OF PROVIDING FOR
               THEIR EMANCIPATION RESTS WITH CONGRESS ALONE. Why, then,
               this heart-rending sympathy for the slaves of Missouri, and this cold
               insensibility, this eternal apathy, towards the slaves in the District of
               Columbia?"

            </p>
            <p>
               It is quite unnecessary to add, that the most distinguished northern
               statesmen of both political parties, have always affirmed the power of
               Congress to abolish slavery in the District: President Van Buren in
               his letter of March 6, 1836, to a committee of gentlemen in North
               Carolina, says, "I would not, from the light now before me, feel myself
               safe in pronouncing that Congress does not possess the power of
               abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia." This declaration
               of the President is consistent with his avowed sentiments touching
               the Missouri question, on which he coincided with such men as Daniel
               D. Tompkins, De Witt Clinton, and others, whose names are a
               host.<a class="notelink" href="#NoteE5wA_FN3"><sup>A</sup></a><a name="FootE5wA_FN3"></a> It is
               consistent, also, with his recommendation in his late message, in
               which, speaking of the District, he strongly urges upon Congress "a
               thorough and careful revision of its local government," speaks of the
               "entire dependence" of the people of the District "upon Congress,"
               recommends that a "uniform system of local government" be adopted,
               and adds, that "although it was selected as the seat of the General
               Government, the site of its public edifices, the depository of its
               archives, and the residence of officers entrusted with large amounts
               of public property, and the management of public business, yet it never
               has been subjected to, or received, that <em>special</em> and
               <em>comprehensive</em> legislation which these circumstances peculiarly
               demanded."

            </p>
            <p><a name="NoteE5wA_FN3"></a><a href="#FootE5wA_FN3">A</a>: Mr. Van Buren, when a member of the Senate of
               New-York, voted for the following preamble and resolutions, which passed
               unanimously:&#8212;Jan 28th, 1820. "Whereas the inhibiting the further
               extension of slavery in the United States, is a subject of deep concern to
               the people of this state: and whereas, we consider slavery as an evil much to
               be deplored, and that <em>every constitutional barrier should be interposed
                  to prevent its further extension</em>: and that the constitution of the
               United States <em>clearly gives congress the right</em> to require new
               states, not comprised within the original boundary of the United States, to
               <em>make the prohibition of slavery</em> a condition of their admission

            <p>
               The tenor of Mr. Tallmadge's speech on the right of petition, and
               of Mr. Webster's on the reception of abolition memorials, may be
               taken as universal exponents of the sentiments of northern statesmen
               as to the power of Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia.

               An explicit declaration, that an "<em>overwhelming majority</em>" of the
               <em>present</em> Congress concede the power to abolish slavery in the
               District, has just been made by Hon. Robert Barnwell Rhett, a member of
               Congress from South Carolina, in a letter published in the Charleston
               Mercury of Dec. 27, 1837. The following is an extract:

            </p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>
                  "The time has arrived when we must have new guaranties under
                  the constitution, or the Union must be dissolved. <em>Our views of the
                     constitution are not those of the majority</em>. AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY
                  <em>think that by the constitution, Congress may abolish slavery in the
                     District of Columbia&#8212;may abolish the slave trade between the States;
                     that is, it may prohibit their being carried out of the State in which they
                     are&#8212;and prohibit it in all the territories, Florida among them. They
                     think</em>, NOT WITHOUT STRONG REASONS, <em>that the power of Congress
                     extends to all of these subjects</em>."

               </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><em>Direct testimony</em> to show that the power of Congress to abolish
               slavery in the District, has always till recently been <em>universally
                  conceded</em>, is perhaps quite superfluous. We subjoin, however, the
               following:

            </p>
            <p>
               The Vice-President of the United States in his speech on the Missouri
               question, quoted above, after contending that the restriction of
               slavery in Missouri would be unconstitutional, declares, that the power
               of Congress over slavery in the District "COULD NOT BE QUESTIONED."
               In the speech of Mr. Smyth, of Va., also quoted above, he declares
               the power of Congress to abolish slavery in the District to be "UNDOUBTED."

            </p>
            <p>
               Mr. Sutherland, of Penn., in a speech in the House of Representatives,
               on the motion to print Mr. Pinckney's Report, is thus reported
               in the Washington Globe, of May 9th, '36. "He replied to the remark
               that the report conceded that Congress had a right to legislate
               upon the subject in the District of Columbia, and said that SUCH A
               RIGHT HAD NEVER BEEN, TILL RECENTLY, DENIED."

            <p>
               The American Quarterly Review, published at Philadelphia, with
               a large circulation and list of contributors in the slave states, holds
               the following language in the September No. 1833, p. 55: "Under
               this 'exclusive jurisdiction,' granted by the constitution, Congress has
               power to abolish slavery and the slave trade in the District of Columbia.
               It would hardly be necessary to state this as a distinct proposition,
               had it not been occasionally questioned. The truth of the assertion,
               however, is too obvious to admit of argument&#8212;and we believe
               HAS NEVER BEEN DISPUTED BY PERSONS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE
               CONSTITUTION."

            <h3><a name="E5wA_OBJ"></a>
               OBJECTIONS TO THE FOREGOING CONCLUSIONS CONSIDERED.

            </h3>
            <p>
               We now proceed to notice briefly the main arguments that have
               been employed in Congress, and elsewhere against the power of Congress

               to abolish slavery in the District. One of the most plausible is;
               that "the conditions on which Maryland and Virginia ceded the District
               to the United States, would be violated, if Congress should
               abolish slavery there." The reply to this is, that Congress had no power
               to <em>accept</em> a cession coupled with conditions restricting that
               "power of exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District,"
               which was given it by the constitution.

            </p>
            <p>
               To show the futility of the objection, we insert here the acts of
               cession. The cession of Maryland was made in November, 1788,
               and is as follows: "An act to cede to Congress a district of ten
               miles square in this state for the seat of the government of the United
               States."

            </p>
            <p>
               "Be it enacted, by the General Assembly of Maryland, that the
               representatives of this state in the House of Representatives of the
               Congress of the United States, appointed to assemble at New-York,
               on the first Wednesday of March next, be, and they are hereby
               authorized and required on the behalf of this state, to cede to the Congress
               of the United States, any district in this state, not exceeding ten
               miles square, which the Congress may fix upon, and accept for the
               seat of government of the United States." Laws of Md., v. 2., c. 46.

            </p>
            <p>
               The cession of Virginia was made on the 3d of December, 1788,
               in the following words:

            </p>
            <p>
               "Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That a tract of country,
               not exceeding ten miles square, or any lesser quantity, to be located
               within the limits of the State, and in any part thereof, as Congress
               may, by law, direct, shall be, and the same is hereby forever ceded
               and relinquished to the Congress and Government of the United States,
               in full and absolute right, and exclusive jurisdiction, as well of soil,
               as of persons residing or to reside thereon, pursuant to the tenor and
               effect of the eighth section of the first article of the government of
               the constitution of the United States."

            </p>
            <p>
               But were there no provisos to these acts? The Maryland act
               had <em>none</em>. The Virginia act had this proviso: "Sect. 2. Provided,
               that nothing herein contained, shall be construed to vest in the United
               States any right of property in the soil, or to affect the rights of
               individuals <em>therein</em>, otherwise than the same shall or may be
               transferred by such individuals to the United States."

            </p>
            <p>
               This specification touching the soil was merely definitive and explanatory
               of that clause in the act of cession, "<em>full and absolute right</em>."
               Instead of restraining the power of Congress on <em>slavery</em> and other
               subjects, it even gives it freer course; for exceptions to <em>parts</em>
               of a rule, give double confirmation to those parts not embraced in the
               exceptions. If it was the <em>design</em> of the proviso to restrict
               congressional action on the subject of <em>slavery</em>,
               why is the <em>soil alone</em> specified? As legal instruments are not
               paragons of economy in words, might not "John Doe," out of his abundance,
               and without spoiling his style, have afforded an additional word&#8212;at
               least a hint&#8212;that slavery was <em>meant</em>, though nothing was
               <em>said</em> about it?

            </p>
            <p>
               But again, Maryland and Virginia, in their acts of cession, declare
               them to be "in pursuance of" that clause of the constitution which
               gives to Congress "exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over"
               the ten miles square&#8212;thus, instead of <em>restricting</em> that
               clause, both States <em>confirm</em> it. Now, their acts of cession either
               accorded with that clause of the constitution, or they conflicted with it. If
               they conflicted with it, <em>accepting</em> the cessions was a violation
               of the constitution. The fact that Congress accepted the cessions, proves that
               in its view their <em>terms</em> did not conflict with its constitutional
               grant of power. The inquiry whether these acts of cession were consistent
               or inconsistent with the United States' constitution, is totally irrelevant
               to the question at issue. What saith the CONSTITUTION? That
               is the question. Not, what saith Virginia, or Maryland, or&#8212;equally
               to the point&#8212;John Bull! If Maryland and Virginia had been the
               authorized interpreters of the constitution for the Union, these acts
               of cession could hardly have been magnified more than they have
               been recently by the southern delegation in Congress. A true understanding
               of the constitution can be had, forsooth, only by holding
               it up in the light of Maryland and Virginia legislation!

            <p>
               We are told, again, that those States would not have ceded the
               District if they had supposed the constitution gave Congress power to
               abolish slavery in it.

            </p>
            <p>
               This comes with an ill grace from Maryland and Virginia. They
               <em>knew</em> the constitution. They were parties to it. They had sifted
               it clause by clause, in their State conventions. They had weighed its
               words in the balance&#8212;they had tested them as by fire; and finally,
               after long pondering, they <em>adopted</em> the constitution. And
               <em>afterward</em>, self-moved, they ceded the ten miles square, and
               declared the cession made "in pursuance of" that oft-cited clause, "Congress
               shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever
               over such District." And now verily "they would not have ceded if
               they had <em>supposed</em>!" &amp;c. Cede it they <em>did</em>, and
               in "full and absolute right both of soil and persons." Congress accepted the
               cession&#8212;state power over the District ceased, and congressional power
               over it commenced&#8212;and now, the sole question to be settled is,
               <em>the amount of power over the District, lodged in Congress by the
                  constitution</em>. The constitution&#8212;THE CONSTITUTION&#8212;that is the
               point. Maryland and Virginia "suppositions" must be potent suppositions to
               abrogate a clause of the United States' Constitution! That clause either gives
               Congress power to abolish slavery in the District, or it does
               <em>not</em>&#8212;and that point is to be settled, not by state
               "suppositions," nor state usages, nor state legislation, but <em>by the
                  terms of the clause themselves</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               Southern members of Congress, in the recent discussions, have
               conceded the power of a contingent abolition in the District, by suspending
               it upon the <em>consent</em> of the people. Such a doctrine from
               <em>declaimers</em> like Messrs. Alford, of Georgia, and Walker, of
               Mississippi, would excite no surprise; but that it should be honored with the
               endorsement

               of such men as Mr. Rives and Mr. Calhoun, is quite unaccountable. Are
               attributes of <em>sovereignty</em> mere creatures of
               <em>contingency</em>? Is delegated <em>authority</em> mere conditional
               <em>permission</em>? Is a <em>constitutional power</em> to be
               exercised by those who hold it, only by popular <em>sufferance?</em> Must
               it lie helpless at the pool of public sentiment, waiting the gracious
               troubling of its waters? Is it a lifeless corpse, save only when popular
               "consent" deigns to puff breath into its nostrils? Besides, if the consent of
               the people of the District be necessary, the consent of the
               <em>whole</em> people must be had&#8212;not that of a majority,
               however large. Majorities, to be authoritative, must be
               <em>legal</em>&#8212;and a legal majority without legislative power, or
               right of representation, or even the electoral franchise, would be truly an
               anomaly! In the District of Columbia, such a thing as a majority in a legal
               sense is unknown to law. To talk of the power of a majority, or the will of a
               majority there, is mere mouthing. A majority? Then it has an
               authoritative will&#8212;and an organ to make it known&#8212;and an executive
               to carry it into effect&#8212;Where are they? We repeat it&#8212;if the
               consent of the people of the District be necessary, the consent of <em>every
                  one</em> is necessary&#8212;and <em>universal</em> consent will come
               only with the Greek Kalends and a "perpetual motion." A single individual
               might thus <em>perpetuate</em> slavery in defiance of the expressed will
               of a whole people. The most common form of this fallacy is given by Mr. Wise,
               of Virginia, in his speech, February 16, 1835, in which he denied the
               power of Congress to abolish slavery in the District, unless the inhabitants
               owning slaves petitioned for it!! Southern members of Congress
               at the present session ring changes almost daily upon the same
               fallacy. What! pray Congress <em>to use</em> a power which it <em>has
                  not</em>? "It is required of a man according to what he <em>hath</em>,"
               saith the Scripture. I commend Mr. Wise to Paul for his ethics. Would that he
               had got his <em>logic</em> of him! If Congress does not possess the power,
               why taunt it with its weakness, by asking its exercise? Why mock it by
               demanding impossibilities? Petitioning, according to Mr. Wise, is, in
               matters of legislation, omnipotence itself; the very <em>source</em> of
               all constitutional power; for, <em>asking</em> Congress to do what it
               <em>cannot</em> do, gives it the power&#8212;to pray the exercise of a
               power that is <em>not, creates</em> it. A beautiful theory! Let us work it
               both ways. If to petition for the exercise of a power that is
               <em>not</em>, creates it&#8212;to petition against the exercise
               of a power that <em>is</em>, annihilates it. As southern gentlemen are
               partial to summary processes, pray, sirs, try the virtue of your own
               recipe on "exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever;" a better subject
               for experiment and test of the prescription could not be had. But
               if the petitions of the citizens of the District give Congress the
               <em>right</em> to abolish slavery, they impose the <em>duty</em>; if
               they confer constitutional <em>authority</em>, they create constitutional
               <em>obligation</em>. If Congress <em>may</em> abolish because of an
               expression of their will, it <em>must</em> abolish at the bidding
               of that will. If the people of the District are a <em>source of power</em>
               to Congress, their <em>expressed</em> will has the force of a
               constitutional provision,

               and has the same binding power upon the National Legislature.
               To make Congress dependent on the District for authority, is to make
               it a <em>subject</em> of its authority, restraining the exercise of its
               own discretion, and sinking it into a mere organ of the District's will. We
               proceed to another objection.

               "<em>The southern states would not have ratified the constitution, if they
                  had supposed that it gave this power.</em>" It is a sufficient answer to
               this objection, that the northern states would not have ratified it, if they
               had supposed that it <em>withheld</em> the power. If "suppositions" are to
               take the place of the constitution&#8212;coming from both sides, they
               neutralize each other. To argue a constitutional question by
               <em>guessing</em> at the "suppositions" that might have been made by the
               parties to it, would find small favor in a court of law. But even a desperate
               shift is some easement when sorely pushed. If this question is to be settled
               by "suppositions" suppositions shall be forthcoming, and that
               without stint.

            </p>
            <p>
               First, then, I affirm that the North ratified the constitution, "supposing"
               that slavery had begun to wax old, and would speedily vanish
               away, and especially that the abolition of the slave trade, which by the
               constitution was to be surrendered to Congress after twenty years,
               would cast it headlong.

            </p>
            <p>
               Would the North have adopted the constitution, giving three-fifths
               of the "slave property" a representation, if it had "supposed" that
               the slaves would have increased from half a million to two millions and
               a half by 1838&#8212;and that the census of 1840 would give to the slave
               states thirty representatives of "slave property?"

            </p>
            <p>
               If they had "supposed" that this representation would have controlled
               the legislation of the government, and carried against the
               North every question vital to its interests, would Hamilton, Franklin,
               Sherman, Gerry, Livingston, Langdon, and Rufus King have been
               such madmen, as to sign the constitution, and the Northern States
               such suicides as to ratify it? Every self-preserving instinct would
               have shrieked at such an infatuate immolation. At the adoption
               of the United States constitution, slavery was regarded as a fast waning
               system. This conviction was universal. Washington, Jefferson,
               Henry, Grayson, Tucker, Madison, Wythe, Pendleton, Lee, Blair,
               Mason, Page, Parker, Randolph, Iredell, Spaight, Ramsey, Pinkney,
               Martin, McHenry, Chase, and nearly all the illustrious names south of
               the Potomac, proclaimed it before the sun. A reason urged in the
               convention that formed the United States constitution, why the word
               slave should not be used in it, was, that <em>when slavery should
                  cease</em>, there might remain upon the National Charter no record that it
               had ever been. (See speech of Mr. Burrill, of R.I., on the Missouri question.)

            </p>
            <p>
               I now proceed to show by testimony, that at the date of the United
               States constitution, and for several years before and after that period,
               slavery was rapidly on the wane; that the American Revolution with
               the great events preceding, accompanying, and following it, had

               wrought an immense and almost universal change in the public sentiment
               of the nation on the subject, powerfully impelling it toward the
               entire abolition of the system&#8212;and that it was the <em>general
                  belief</em> that measures for its abolition throughout the Union, would be
               commenced by the individual States generally before the lapse of many years. A
               great mass of testimony establishing this position might be presented,
               but narrow space, and the importance of speedy publication, counsel
               brevity. Let the following proofs suffice. First, a few dates as points
               of observation.

               The first <em>general</em> Congress met in 1774. The revolutionary war
               commenced in '75. Independence was declared in '76. The articles
               of confederation were adopted by the thirteen states in '78. Independence
               acknowledged in '83. The convention for forming the U.S.
               constitution was held in '87, the state conventions for considering it in
               '87, and '88. The first Congress under the constitution in '89.

               Dr. Rush, of Pennsylvania, one of the signers of the Declaration
               of Independence, in a letter to Granville Sharpe, May 1, 1773, says
               "A spirit of humanity and religion begins to awaken in several of the
               colonies in favor of the poor negroes. Great events have been brought
               about by small beginnings. <em>Anthony Benezet stood alone a few years
                  ago in opposing negro slavery in Philadelphia</em>, and NOW THREE-FOURTHS
               OF THE PROVINCE AS WELL AS OF THE CITY CRY OUT AGAINST
               IT."&#8212;[Stuart's Life of Sharpe, p. 21.]

               In the preamble to the act prohibiting the importation of slaves
               into Rhode Island, June, 1774, is the following: "Whereas the inhabitants
               of America are generally engaged in the preservation of their
               own rights and liberties, among which that of personal freedom must
               be considered the greatest, and as those who are desirous of enjoying
               all the advantages of liberty themselves, <em>should be willing to extend
                  personal liberty to others</em>, therefore," &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               October 20, 1774, the Continental Congress passed the following:
               "We, for ourselves and the inhabitants of the several colonies whom
               we represent, <em>firmly agree and associate under the sacred ties of
                  virtue, honor, and love of our country</em>, as follows:

            </p>
            <p>
               "2d Article. We <em>will neither import nor purchase any slaves
                  imported</em> after the first day of December next, after which time we will
               <em>wholly discontinue</em> the slave trade, and we will neither be
               concerned in it ourselves, nor will we hire our vessels, nor sell our
               commodities or manufactures to those who are concerned in it."

            </p>
            <p>
               The Continental Congress, in 1775, setting forth the causes and
               the necessity for taking up arms, say: "<em>If it were possible</em> for
               men who exercise their reason to believe that the divine Author of our
               existence intended a part of the human race to <em>hold an absolute property
                  in, and unbounded power over others</em>," &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               In 1776, Dr. Hopkins, then at the head of New England divines,
               in "An Address to the owners of negro slaves in the American colonies,"
               says: "The conviction of the unjustifiableness of this practice
               (slavery) has been <em>increasing</em>, and <em>greatly spreading of
                  late</em>, and <em>many</em>
               who have had slaves, have found themselves so unable to justify their
               own conduct in holding them in bondage, as to be induced to <em>set them
                  at liberty</em>.&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slavery
               is, <em>in every instance</em>, wrong, unrighteous, and
               oppressive&#8212;a very great and crying sin&#8212;<em>there being nothing
                  of the kind equal to it on the face of the earth.</em>"

            </p>
            <p>
               The same year the American Congress issued a solemn MANIFESTO
               to the world. These were its first words: "We hold these truths to
               be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed
               by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these
               are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." <em>Once</em>, these
               were words of power; <em>now</em>, "a rhetorical flourish."

               The celebrated Patrick Henry of Virginia, in a letter, of Jan. 18,
               1773, to Robert Pleasants, afterwards president of the Virginia Abolition
               Society, says: "Believe me, I shall honor the Quakers for their
               noble efforts to abolish slavery. It is a debt we owe to the purity of
               our religion to show that it is at variance with that law that warrants
               slavery. I exhort you to persevere in so worthy a resolution."

            </p>
            <p>
               In 1779, the Continental Congress ordered a pamphlet to be published,
               entitled, "Observations on the American Revolution," from
               which the following is an extract: "The great principle (of government)
               is and ever will remain in force, <em>that men are by nature free</em>;
               and so long as we have any idea of divine <em>justice</em>, we must
               associate that of <em>human freedom</em>. It is <em>conceded on all
                  hands, that the right to be free</em> CAN NEVER BE ALIENATED."

               Extract from the Pennsylvania act for the abolition of slavery,
               passed March 1, 1780:&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;"We
               conceive that it is our duty, and we rejoice that it is in our power, to

               Weaned by a long course of experience from those narrow prejudices and
               partialities we had imbibed, we find our hearts enlarged with kindness and
               benevolence towards men of all conditions and nations:&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;Therefore

               Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia, written just before the close of
               the Revolutionary War, says: "I think a change already perceptible
               since the origin of the present revolution. The spirit of the master is
               abating, that of the slave is rising from the dust, his condition mollifying,
               <em>the way I hope preparing under the auspices of heaven</em>, FOR A
               TOTAL EMANCIPATION."

            </p>
            <p>
               In a letter to Dr. Price, of London, who had just published a
               pamphlet in favor of the abolition of slavery, Mr. Jefferson, then minister
               at Paris, (August 7, 1785,) says: "From the mouth to the
               head of the Chesapeake, <em>the bulk of the people will approve of your
                  pamphlet in theory</em>, and it will find a respectable minority ready to
               <em>adopt it in practice</em>&#8212;a minority which, for weight and worth
               of character, <em>preponderates against the greater number</em>." Speaking
               of Virginia, he says: "This is the next state to which we may turn our
               eyes for the interesting spectacle of justice in conflict with avarice

               and oppression,&#8212;a conflict in which THE SACRED SIDE IS GAINING
               DAILY RECRUITS. Be not, therefore, discouraged&#8212;what you have
               written will do a <em>great deal of good</em>; and could you still
               trouble yourself with our welfare, no man is more able to give aid to the
               laboring side. The College of William and Mary, since the remodelling of its
               plan, is the place where are collected together all the young men of
               Virginia, under preparation for public life. They are there under the
               direction (most of them) of a Mr. Wythe, one of the most virtuous of
               characters, and <em>whose sentiments on the subject of slavery are
                  unequivocal.</em> I am satisfied, if you could resolve to address an
               exhortation to those young men with all that eloquence of which you are
               master, that <em>its influence on the future decision of this important
                  question would be great, perhaps decisive.</em> Thus, you see, that so far
               from thinking you have cause to repent of what you have done, <em>I wish
                  you to do more, and wish it on an assurance of its
                  effect.</em>"&#8212;Jefferson's Posthumous Works, vol. 1, p. 268.

               In 1786, John Jay drafted and signed a petition to the Legislature
               of New York, on the subject of slavery, beginning with these words:
               "Your memorialists being deeply affected by the situation of those,
               who, although FREE BY THE LAW OF GOD, are held in slavery by the
               laws of the State," &amp;c. This memorial bore also the signatures of
               the celebrated Alexander Hamilton; Robert R. Livingston, afterward Secretary
               of Foreign Affairs of the United States, and Chancellor of the State of
               New-York; James Duane, Major of the City of New-York, and many others of the
               most eminent individuals in the State.

            </p>
            <p>
               In the preamble of an instrument, by which Mr. Jay emancipated
               a slave in 1784, is the following passage:

            </p>
            <p>
               "Whereas, the children of men are by nature equally free, and
               cannot, without injustice, be either reduced to or HELD in slavery."

            </p>
            <p>
               In his letter while Minister at Spain, in 1786, he says, speaking
               of the abolition of slavery: "Till America comes into this measure,
               her prayers to heaven will be IMPIOUS. I believe God governs the
               world; and I believe it to be a maxim in his, as in our court, that
               those who ask for equity <em>ought to do it.</em>"

            </p>
            <p>
               In 1785, the New-York Manumission Society was formed.
               John Jay was chosen its first President, and held the office for five years.
               Alexander Hamilton was its second President, and after holding the
               office one year, resigned upon his removal to Philadelphia as Secretary of
               the United States' Treasury. In 1787, the Pennsylvania Abolition Society
               was formed. Benjamin Franklin, warm from the discussions of the convention
               that formed the U.S. constitution, was chosen President, and Benjamin Rush,
               Secretary&#8212;both signers of the Declaration of Independence. In 1789, the
               Maryland Abolition Society was formed. Among its officers were Samuel Chace,
               Judge of the U.S. Supreme Court, and Luther Martin, a member of the
               convention that formed the U.S. constitution. In 1790, the Connecticut
               Abolition Society was formed. The first President was Rev. Dr.

               Stiles, President of Yale College, and the Secretary, Simeon Baldwin,
               (the late Judge Baldwin of New Haven.) In 1791, this Society sent
               a memorial to Congress, from which the following is an extract:

            </p>
            <blockquote>

                  "From a sober conviction of the unrighteousness of slavery, your
                  petitioners have long beheld, with grief, our fellow men doomed to perpetual
                  bondage, in a country which boasts of her freedom. Your
                  petitioners are fully of opinion; that calm reflection will at last convince
                  the world, that the whole system of African slavery IS unjust in
                  its nature&#8212;impolitic in its principles&#8212;and, in its consequences,
                  ruinous to the industry and enterprise of the citizens of these States. From a
                  conviction of those truths, your petitioners were led, by motives, we
                  conceive, of general philanthropy, to associate ourselves for the protection
                  and assistance of this unfortunate part of our fellow men; and,
                  though this Society has been <em>lately</em> established, it has now
                  become <em>generally extensive</em> through this state, and, we fully
                  believe, <em>embraces, on this subject, the sentiments of a large majority
                     of its citizens.</em>"

               The same year the Virginia Abolition Society was formed. This
               Society, and the Maryland Society, had auxiliaries in different parts
               of those States. Both societies sent up memorials to Congress. The
               memorial of the Virginia Society is headed&#8212;"The memorial of the
               <em>Virginia Society</em>, for promoting the Abolition of Slavery,
               &amp;c." The following is an extract:

            <blockquote>

                  degradation, but an <em>outrageous violation of one of the most essential
                     rights of human nature, and utterly repugnant to the precepts of the
                     gospel</em>, lament that a practice so inconsistent with true policy and
                  the inalienable rights of men, should subsist in so enlightened an age, and
                  among a people professing, that all mankind are, by nature, equally
                  entitled to freedom."

               About the same time a Society was formed in New Jersey. It
               had an acting committee of five members in each county in the State.
               The following is an extract from the preamble to its constitution:

            <blockquote>
               <p>

                  <em>liberty</em>, and the <em>pursuit of happiness</em>, are
                  recognized as the universal rights of men; and whilst we are anxious to
                  preserve these rights to ourselves, and transmit them inviolate, to our
                  posterity, we <em>abhor that inconsistent, illiberal, and interested policy,

               Among other distinguished individuals who were efficient officers
               of these Abolition Societies, and delegates from their respective state
               societies, at the annual meetings of the American convention for promoting
               the abolition of slavery, were Hon. Uriah Tracy, United
               States' Senator, from Connecticut; Hon. Zephaniah Swift, Chief Justice
               of the same State; Hon. Cesar A. Rodney, Attorney General of

               In July, 1787, the old Congress passed the celebrated ordinance
               abolishing slavery in the northwestern territory, and declaring that
               it should never thereafter exist there. This ordinance was passed
               while the convention that formed the United States' constitution was
               in session. At the first session of Congress under the constitution,
               this ordinance was ratified by a special act. Washington, fresh from
               the discussions of the convention, in which <em>more than forty days had
                  been spent in adjusting the question of slavery, gave it his approval.</em>
               The act passed with only one dissenting voice, (that of Mr. Yates, of
               New York,) <em>the South equally with the North avowing the fitness and
                  expediency of the measure on general considerations, and indicating
                  thus early the line of national policy, to be pursued by the United
                  States' Government on the subject of slavery</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               In the debates in the North Carolina Convention, Mr. Iredell,
               afterward a Judge of the United States' Supreme Court, said, "<em>When
                  the entire abolition of slavery takes place</em>, it will be an event which
               must be pleasing to every generous mind and every friend of human
               nature." Mr. Galloway said, "I wish to see this abominable trade
               put an end to. I apprehend the clause (touching the slave trade)
               means <em>to bring forward manumission</em>." Luther Martin, of Maryland,
               a member of the convention that formed the United States Constitution, said,
               "We ought to authorize the General Government to make such regulations as
               shall be thought most advantageous for <em>the gradual abolition of
                  slavery</em>, and the <em>emancipation of the slaves</em> which are
               already in the States." Judge Wilson, of Pennsylvania, one of the
               framers of the constitution, said, in the Pennsylvania convention of '87,
               [Deb. Pa. Con. p. 303, 156:] "I consider this (the clause relative to
               the slave trade) as laying the foundation for <em>banishing slavery out of
                  this country</em>. It will produce the same kind of gradual change which
               was produced in Pennsylvania; the new states which are to be formed
               will be under the control of Congress in this particular, and <em>slaves
                  will never be introduced</em> among them. It presents us with the pleasing
               prospect that the rights of mankind will be acknowledged and established
               <em>throughout the Union</em>. Yet the lapse of a few years, and
               Congress will have power to <em>exterminate slavery</em> within our
               borders." In the Virginia convention of '87, Mr. Mason, author of the Virginia
               constitution, said, "The augmentation of slaves weakens the States,
               and such a trade is <em>diabolical</em> in itself, and disgraceful to
               mankind. As much as I value a union of all the states, I would not admit the
               southern states, (i.e., South Carolina and Georgia,) into the union,
               <em>unless they agree to a discontinuance of this disgraceful
                  trade</em>." Mr. Tyler opposed with great power the clause prohibiting the
               abolition of the slave trade till 1808, and said, "My earnest desire is, that
               it shall be handed down to posterity that I oppose this wicked clause." Mr.
               Johnson said, "The principle of emancipation <em>has begun since the
                  revolution. Let us do what we will, it will come round</em>."&#8212;[Deb.
               Va.

               Con. p. 463.] Patrick Henry, arguing the power of Congress under
               the United States' constitution to abolish slavery in the States, said, in
               the same convention, "Another thing will contribute to bring this
               event (the abolition of slavery) about. Slavery is <em>detested</em>. We
               feel its fatal effects; we deplore it with all the pity of
               humanity."&#8212;[Deb. Va. Con. p. 431.] In the Mass. Con. of '88, Judge Dawes
               said, "Although slavery is not smitten by an apoplexy, yet <em>it has
                  received a mortal wound</em>, and will die of consumption."&#8212;[Deb.
               Mass. Con. p. 60.] General Heath said that, "Slavery was confined to the
               States <em>now existing</em>, it <em>could not be extended</em>. By
               their ordinance, Congress had declared that the new States should be
               republican States, <em>and have no slavery</em>."&#8212;p. 147.

               In the debate, in the first Congress, February 11th and 12th, 1789,
               on the petitions of the Society of Friends, and the Pennsylvania Abolition
               Society, Mr. Parker, of Virginia, said, "I cannot help expressing
               the pleasure I feel in finding <em>so considerable a part</em> of the
               community attending to matters of such a momentous concern to the
               <em>future prosperity</em> and happiness of the people of America. I think
               it my duty, as a citizen of the Union, <em>to espouse their cause</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               Mr. Page, of Virginia, (afterward Governor)&#8212;"Was <em>in favor</em>
               of the commitment; he hoped that the designs of the respectable
               memorialists would not be stopped at the threshold, in order to preclude a
               fair discussion of the prayer of the memorial. With respect
               to the alarm that was apprehended, he conjectured there was none;
               but there might be just cause, if the memorial was <em>not</em> taken
               into consideration. He placed himself in the case of a slave, and said, that
               on hearing that Congress had refused to listen to the decent suggestions of
               a respectable part of the community, he should infer, that
               the general government, <em>from which was expected great good would
                  result to</em> EVERY CLASS <em>of citizens</em>, had shut their ears
               against the voice of humanity, and he should despair of any alleviation of the
               miseries he and his posterity had in prospect; if any thing could induce him
               to rebel, it must be a stroke like this, impressing on his
               mind all the horrors of despair. But if he was told, that application
               was made in his behalf, and that Congress were willing to hear what
               could be urged in favor of discouraging the practice of importing
               his fellow-wretches, he would trust in their justice and humanity,
               and <em>wait the decision patiently</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               Mr. Scott of Pennsylvania: "I cannot, for my part, conceive
               how any person <em>can be said to acquire a property in another</em>. Let
               us argue on principles countenanced by reason, and becoming humanity.
               <em>I do not know how far I might go, if I was one of the judges of the
                  United States, and those people were to came before me and claim
                  their emancipation, but I am sure I would go as far as I could</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               Mr. Burke, of South Carolina, said, "He <em>saw the disposition of
                  the House</em>, and he feared it would he referred to a committee, maugre
               all their opposition."

            </p>
            <p>
               Mr. Smith of South Carolina, said, "That on entering into this

               government, they (South Carolina and Georgia) apprehended that
               the other states,&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>would, from motives of humanity and
                  benevolence, be led to vote for a general emancipation</em>."

               In the debate, at the same session, May 13th, 1789, on the petition of the
               Society of Friends respecting the slave trade, Mr. Parker,
               of Virginia, said, "He hoped Congress would do all that lay in their
               power <em>to restore to human nature its inherent privileges</em>. The
               inconsistency in our principles, with which we are justly charged
               <em>should be done away</em>."

            </p>
            <p>
               Mr. Jackson, of Georgia, said, "IT WAS THE FASHION OF THE DAY

               (then the government paper,) who opposes the abolition of slavery,
               and avows himself a <em>slaveholder</em>, says, "I have seen in the
               papers accounts of <em>large associations</em>, and applications to
               Government for <em>the abolition of slavery</em>. Religion, humanity, and
               the generosity natural to a free people, are the <em>noble principles which
                  dictate those measures</em>. SUCH MOTIVES COMMAND RESPECT, AND ARE ABOVE ANY
               EULOGIUM WORDS CAN BESTOW."

            <p>
               In the convention that formed the constitution of Kentucky in
               1790, the effort to prohibit slavery was nearly successful. A decided
               majority of that body would undoubtedly have voted for its exclusion,
               but for the great efforts and influence of two large slaveholders&#8212;men
               of commanding talents and sway&#8212;Messrs. Breckenridge and Nicholas. The
               following extract from a speech made in that convention
               by a member of it, Mr. Rice a native Virginian, is a specimen of
               the <em>free discussion</em> that prevailed on that "delicate subject."
               Said Mr. Rice: "I do a man greater injury, when I deprive him of his
               liberty, than when I deprive him of his property. It is vain for me
               to plead that I have the sanction of law; for this makes the injury
               the greater&#8212;it arms the community against him, and makes his case

               desperate. The owners of such slaves then are <em>licensed robbers</em>,
               and not the just proprietors of what they claim. Freeing them is not
               depriving them of property, but <em>restoring it to the right owner</em>.
               In America, a slave is a standing monument of the tyranny and inconsistency
               of human governments. The master is the enemy of the
               slave; he <em>has made open war upon him</em>, AND IS DAILY CARRYING IT
               ON in unremitted efforts. Can any one imagine, then, that the slave
               is indebted to his master, and <em>bound to serve him</em>? Whence can the
               obligation arise? What is it founded upon? What is my duty to an
               enemy that is carrying on war against me? I do not deny, but in
               some circumstances, it is the duty of the slave to serve; but it is a
               duty he owes himself, and not his master."

               President Edwards, the younger, said, in a sermon preached before
               the Connecticut Abolition Society, Sept. 15, 1791: "Thirty years
               ago, scarcely a man in this country thought either the slave trade or
               the slavery of negroes to be wrong; but now how many and able
               advocates in private life, in our legislatures, in Congress, have
               appeared, and have openly and irrefragably pleaded the rights of
               humanity in this as well as other instances? And if we judge of the
               future by the past, <em>within fifty years from this time, it will be as
                  shameful for a man to hold a negro slave, as to be guilty of common
                  robbery or theft</em>."

               In 1794, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian church adopted
               its "Scripture proofs," notes, comments, &amp;c. Among these was the
               following:

            </p>
            <blockquote>
               <p>
                  "1 Tim. i. 10. The law is made for manstealers. This crime
                  among the Jews exposed the perpetrators of it to capital punishment.
                  Exodus xxi. 16. And the apostle here classes them with <em>sinners of
                     the first rank</em>. The word he uses, in its original import comprehends
                  all who are concerned in bringing any of the human race into slavery,
                  or in <em>retaining</em> them in it. <em>Stealers of men</em> are all
                  those who bring off slaves or freemen, and <em>keep</em>, sell, or buy
                  them."

               In 1794, Dr. Rush declared: "Domestic slavery is repugnant to
               the principles of Christianity. It prostrates every benevolent and just
               principle of action in the human heart. It is rebellion against the
               authority of a common Father. It is a practical denial of the extent
               and efficacy of the death of a common Savior. It is an usurpation of
               the prerogative of the great Sovereign of the universe, who has
               solemnly claimed an exclusive property in the souls of men."

               In 1790, Mr. Fiske, then an officer of Dartmouth College, afterward
               a Judge in Tennessee, said, in an oration published that year,
               speaking of slaves: "I steadfastly maintain, that we must bring them
               to <em>an equal standing, in point of privileges, with the whites</em>!
               They must enjoy all the rights belonging to human nature."

               When the petition on the abolition of the slave trade was under discussion
               in the Congress of '89, Mr. Brown, of North Carolina, said,
               "The emancipation of the slaves <em>will be effected</em> in time; it
               ought to be a gradual business, but he hoped that Congress would not
               <i>precipitate</i>
               it to the great injury of the southern States." Mr. Hartley, of
               Pennsylvania, said, in the same debate, "<em>He was not a little surprised
                  to hear the cause of slavery advocated in that house.</em>" WASHINGTON,
               in a letter to Sir John Sinclair, says, "There are, in Pennsylvania,
               laws for the gradual abolition of slavery which neither Maryland nor
               Virginia have at present, but which <em>nothing is more certain</em> than
               that they <em>must have</em>, and at a period NOT REMOTE." In 1782,
               Virginia passed her celebrated manumission act. Within nine years from that
               time nearly eleven thousand slaves were voluntarily emancipated by
               their masters. Judge Tucker's "Dissertation on Slavery," p. 72. In
               1787, Maryland passed an act legalizing manumission. Mr. Dorsey,
               of Maryland, in a speech in Congress, December 27th, 1826, speaking
               of manumissions under that act, said, that "<em>The progress of emancipation
                  was astonishing</em>, the State became crowded with a free black
               population."

            </p>
            <p>
               The celebrated William Pinkney, in a speech before the Maryland
               House of Delegates, in 1789, on the emancipation of slaves, said,
               "Sir, by the eternal principles of natural justice, <em>no master in the
                  state has a right to hold his slave in bondage for a single hour</em>....
               I would as soon believe the incoherent tale of a schoolboy, who should
               tell me he had been frightened by a ghost, as that the grant of this
               permission (to emancipate) ought in any degree to alarm us. Are
               we apprehensive that these men will become more dangerous by becoming
               freemen? Are we alarmed, lest by being admitted into the
               enjoyment of civil rights, they will be inspired with a deadly enmity
               against the rights of others? Strange, unaccountable paradox! How
               much more rational would it be, to argue that the natural enemy of
               the privileges of a freeman, is he who is robbed of them himself! Dishonorable
               to the species is the idea that they would ever prove injurious
               to our interests&#8212;released from the shackles of slavery, by the
               justice of government and the bounty of individuals&#8212;the want of fidelity
               and attachment would be next to impossible."

               Hon. James Campbell, in an address before the Pennsylvania Society
               of the Cincinnati, July 4, 1787, said, "Our separation from
               Great Britain has extended the empire of humanity. The time <em>is not
                  far distant</em> when our sister states, in imitation of our example,
               <em>shall turn their vassals into freemen</em>." The Convention that
               formed the United States' Constitution being then in session, attended at the
               delivery of this oration with General Washington at their head.

               A Baltimore paper of September 8th, 1780, contains the following
               notice of Major General Gates: "A few days ago passed through
               this town the Hon. General Gates and lady. The General, previous
               to leaving Virginia, summoned his numerous family of slaves about
               him, and amidst their tears of affection and gratitude, gave them their
               FREEDOM."

               In 1791 the university of William and Mary, in Virginia, conferred
               upon Granville Sharpe the degree of Doctor of Laws. Sharpe was
               at that time the acknowledged head of British abolitionists. His indefatigable

               exertions, prosecuted for years in the case of Somerset, procured that
               memorable decision in the Court of King's Bench, which settled the principle
               that no slave could be held in England. He was
               most uncompromising in his opposition to slavery, and for twenty
               years previous he had spoken, written, and accomplished more against
               it than any man living.

               In the "Memoirs of the Revolutionary War in the Southern Department," by Gen.
               Lee, of Va., Commandant of the Partizan Legion, is the following: "The
               Constitution of the United States, adopted lately with so much difficulty,
               has effectually provided against this evil, (by importation) after a few
               years. It is much to be lamented that having done so much in this way,
               <em>a provision had not been made for the gradual abolition of
                  slavery</em>."&#8212;p. 233, 4.

               Mr. Tucker, of Virginia, Judge of the Supreme Court of that state,
               and professor of law in the University of William and Mary, addressed a
               letter to the General Assembly of that state, in 1796, urging
               the abolition of slavery; from which the following is an extract.
               Speaking of the slaves in Virginia, he says: "Should we not, at the
               time of the revolution, have loosed their chains and broken their fetters;
               or if the difficulties and dangers of such an experiment prohibited the
               attempt, during the convulsions of a revolution, is it not
               our duty, <em>to embrace the first moment</em> of constitutional health
               and vigor to effectuate so desirable an object, and to remove from us a
               stigma with which our enemies will never fail to upbraid us, nor
               our consciences to reproach us?"

               Mr. Faulkner, in a speech before the Virginia Legislature, Jan.
               20, 1832, said&#8212;"The idea of a gradual emancipation and removal of
               the slaves from this commonwealth, is coeval with the declaration of
               our independence from the British yoke. It sprung into existence during
               the first session of the General Assembly, subsequent to the formation
               of your republican government. When Virginia stood sustained in her
               legislation by the pure and philosophic intellect of Pendleton&#8212;by the
               patriotism of Mason and Lee&#8212;by the searching vigor
               and sagacity of Wythe, and by the all-embracing, all-comprehensive
               genius of Thomas Jefferson! Sir, it was a committee composed of
               those five illustrious men, who, in 1777, submitted to the general
               assembly of this state, then in session, <em>a plan for the
                  gradual emancipation of the slaves of this commonwealth</em>."

               Hon. Benjamin Watkins Leigh, late United States' senator from
               Virginia, in his letters to the people of Virginia, in 1832, signed
               Appomattox, p. 43, says: "I thought, till very lately, that it was known
               to every body that during the Revolution, <em>and for many years after,
                  the abolition of slavery was a favorite topic with many of our ablest
                  statesmen</em>, who entertained, with respect, all the schemes which wisdom
               or ingenuity could suggest for accomplishing the object. Mr. Wythe, to the
               day of his death, <em>was for a simple abolition, considering the objection
                  to color as founded in prejudice</em>. By degrees, all

               projects of the kind were abandoned. Mr. Jefferson <em>retained</em> his
               opinion, and now we have these projects revived."

               Governor Barbour, of Virginia, in his speech in the U.S. Senate,
               on the Missouri question, Jan. 1820, said:&#8212;"We are asked why has
               Virginia <em>changed her policy</em> in reference to slavery? That the
               sentiments of <em>our most distinguished men</em>, for thirty
               years <em>entirely corresponded</em> with the course which the
               friends of the restriction (of slavery in Missouri) now advocated; and that
               the Virginia delegation, one of whom was the late President of the United
               States, voted for the restriction, (of slavery) in the northwestern territory,
               and that Mr. Jefferson has delineated a gloomy picture of the baneful effects
               of slavery. When it is recollected that the Notes of Mr. Jefferson
               were written during the progress of the revolution, it is no matter of
               surprise that the writer should have imbibed a large portion of that
               enthusiasm which such an occasion was so well calculated to produce.
               As to the consent of the Virginia delegation to the restriction in
               question, whether the result of a disposition to restrain the slave trade
               indirectly, or the influence of that enthusiasm to which I have just
               alluded,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* it is not now important
               to decide. We have witnessed its effects. The liberality of Virginia, or, as
               the result may prove, her folly, which submitted to, or, if you will,
               PROPOSED <em>this measure</em>, (abolition of slavery in the N.W.
               territory) has eventuated in effects which speak a monitory lesson.
               <em>How is the representation from this quarter on the present
                  question?</em>"

               Mr. Imlay, in his early history of Kentucky, p. 185, says: "We
               have disgraced the fair face of humanity, and trampled upon the sacred
               privileges of man, at the very moment that we were exclaiming
               against the tyranny of your (the English) ministry. But in contending for
               the birthright of freedom, we have learned to feel <em>for the
                  bondage of others</em>, and in the libations we offer to the goddess of
               liberty, we <em>contemplate an emancipation of the slaves of this
                  country</em>, as honorable to themselves as it will be glorious to us."

               lay a tax on the importation of slaves, Mr. Clark of Va. said: "He
               was no advocate for a system of slavery." Mr. Marion, of S. Carolina, said:
               "He never had purchased, nor should he ever purchase a slave." Mr. Southard
               said: "Not revenue, but an expression of the <em>national sentiment</em>
               is the principal object." Mr. Smilie&#8212;"I rejoice that the word (slave)
               is not in the constitution; its not being there does honor to the worthies
               who would not suffer it to become a <em>part</em> of it." Mr. Alston,
               of N. Carolina&#8212;"In two years we shall have the power to prohibit the
               trade altogether. Then this House will be UNANIMOUS. No one will object to
               our exercising our full constitutional powers." National Intelligencer,

               These witnesses need no vouchers to entitle them to credit; nor their

               Our readers are of age. Whosoever hath ears to <em>hear</em>, let

               the founders of the government, its chief magistrates, judges, legislators
               and sages, who dared and periled all under the burdens, and
               in the heat of the day that tried men's souls&#8212;then "neither will he

            </p>
            <p>
               Some of the points established by the testimony are&#8212;The universal
               expectation that the <em>moral</em> influence of Congress, of state
               legislatures, of seminaries of learning, of churches, of the ministers of
               religion, and of public sentiment widely embodied in abolition societies,
               would be exerted against slavery, calling forth by argument and appeal
               the moral sense of the nation, and creating a power of opinion
               that would abolish the system throughout the union. In a word, that
               free speech and a free press would be wielded against slavery without
               ceasing and without restriction. Full well did the south know, not
               only that the national government would probably legislate against
               slavery wherever the constitution placed it within its reach, but she
               knew also that Congress had already marked out the line of national
               policy to be pursued on the subject&#8212;had committed itself before the
               world to a course of action against slavery, wherever she could move
               upon it without encountering a conflicting jurisdiction&#8212;that the nation
               had established by solemn ordinance memorable precedent for
               subsequent action, by abolishing slavery in the northwest territory,
               and by declaring that it should never thenceforward exist there; and this
               too, as soon as by cession of Virginia and other states, the territory came
               under Congressional control. The south knew also that the sixth article
               in the ordinance prohibiting slavery was first proposed by the largest
               slaveholding state in the confederacy&#8212;that the chairman of the committee
               that reported the ordinance was a slaveholder&#8212;that the ordinance
               was enacted by Congress during the session of the convention
               that formed the United States Constitution&#8212;that the provisions of the
               ordinance were, both while in prospect, and when under discussion,
               matters of universal notoriety and <em>approval</em> with all parties, and
               when finally passed, received the vote <em>of every member of Congress from
                  each of the slaveholding states</em>. The south also had every reason for
               believing that the first Congress under the constitution would
               <em>ratify</em> that ordinance&#8212;as it <em>did</em> unanimously.

               A crowd of reflections, suggested by the preceding testimony,

               haste, call for their discussion as with the voices of departing

            </p>
            <p>
               The seventh article of the amendments to the constitution is
               alleged to withhold from Congress the power to abolish slavery in the
               District. "No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property,
               without due process of law." All the slaves in the District have been
               "deprived of liberty" by legislative acts. Now, these legislative acts
               "depriving" them "of liberty," were either "due process of law,"
               or they were <em>not</em>. If they <em>were</em>, then a legislative
               act, taking from the master that "property" which is the identical "liberty"
               previously taken from the slave, would be "due process of law"
               <em>also</em>, and of course a <em>constitutional</em> act; but if
               the legislative acts "depriving" them of "liberty" were <em>not</em>
               "due process of law," then the slaves were deprived of liberty
               <em>unconstitutionally</em>, and these acts are <em>void</em>.
               In that case the <em>constitution emancipates them</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               If the objector reply, by saying that the import of the phrase
               "due process of law," is <em>judicial</em> process solely, it is granted,
               and that fact is our rejoinder; for no slave in the District <em>has</em>
               been deprived of his liberty by "a judicial process," or, in other words, by
               "due process of law;" consequently, upon the objector's own admission,
               every slave in the District has been deprived of liberty
               <em>unconstitutionally</em>, and is therefore <em>free by the
                  constitution</em>. This is asserted only of the slaves under the "exclusive
               legislation" of Congress.

            </p>
            <p>
               The last clause of the article under consideration is quoted for the
               same purpose: "Nor shall private property be taken for public use
               without just compensation." Each of the state constitutions has a
               clause of similar purport. The abolition of slavery in the District by
               Congress, would not, as we shall presently show, violate this clause
               either directly or by implication. Granting for argument's sake, that
               slaves are "private property," and that to emancipate them, would
               be to "take private property" for "public use," the objector admits
               the power of Congress to do <em>this</em>, provided it will do something
               <em>else</em>, that is, <em>pay</em> for them. Thus, instead of
               denying the <em>power</em>, the objector not only admits, but
               <em>affirms</em> it, as the ground of the inference that
               compensation must accompany it. So far from disproving the existence
               of <em>one</em> power, the objector asserts the existence of
               <em>two</em>&#8212;one, the power to take the slaves from their masters,
               the other, the power to take the property of the United States to pay for
               them.

            </p>
            <p>
               If Congress cannot constitutionally impair the right of private
               property, or take it without compensation, it cannot constitutionally,
               <em>legalise</em> the perpetration of such acts, by <em>others</em>,
               nor <em>protect</em> those who commit them. Does the power to rob a man
               of his earnings, rob the

               earner of his right to them? Who has a better right to the
               <em>product</em> than the producer?&#8212;to the <em>interest</em>,
               than the owner of the <em>principal</em>?&#8212;to the hands and arms,
               than he from whose shoulders they swing?&#8212;to the body and soul, than he
               whose they <em>are</em>? Congress not only impairs but annihilates the
               right of private property, while it withholds from the slaves of the District
               their title to <em>themselves</em>. What! Congress powerless to protect
               a man's right to <em>himself</em>, when it can make inviolable the right
               to a <em>dog</em>! But, waving this, I deny that the abolition
               of slavery in the District would violate this clause. What does
               the clause prohibit? The "taking" of "private property" for "public
               use." Suppose Congress should emancipate the slaves in the District,
               what would it "<em>take</em>?" Nothing. What would it <em>hold</em>?
               Nothing. What would it put to "public use?" Nothing. Instead of
               <em>taking</em> "private property," Congress, by abolishing slavery, would
               say "<em>private property</em> shall not <em>be</em> taken; and those
               who have been robbed of it already, shall be kept out of it no longer; and
               since every man's right to his own body is <em>paramount</em>, he shall
               be protected in it." True, Congress may not arbitrarily take property,
               <em>as</em> property, from one man and give it to another&#8212;and in
               the abolition of slavery no such thing is done. A legislative act changes the
               <em>condition</em> of the slave&#8212;makes him his own
               <em>proprietor</em> instead of the property of another. It determines a
               question of <em>original right</em> between two classes of
               persons&#8212;doing an act of justice to one, and restraining the other from
               acts of injustice; or, in other words, preventing one from robbing the other,
               by granting to the injured party the protection of just and equitable laws.

            </p>
            <p>
               Congress, by an act of abolition, would change the condition of
               seven thousand "persons" in the District, but would "take" nothing.
               To construe this provision so as to enable the citizens of the District
               to hold as property, and in perpetuity, whatever they please, or to
               hold it as property in all circumstances&#8212;all necessity, public welfare,
               and the will and power of the government to the contrary
               notwithstanding&#8212;is a total perversion of its whole
               <em>intent</em>. The <em>design</em> of the provision, was to throw
               up a barrier against Governmental aggrandizement. The right to "take property"
               for <em>State uses</em> is one thing;&#8212;the right so to adjust the
               <em>tenures</em> by which property is held, that <em>each may have his
                  own secured to him</em>, is another thing, and clearly within the scope of
               legislation. Besides, if Congress were to "take" the slaves in the District,
               it would be <em>adopting</em>, not abolishing slavery&#8212;becoming a
               slaveholder itself, instead of requiring others to be such no longer. The
               clause in question, prohibits the "taking" of individual property for public
               uses, to be employed or disposed of as property for governmental purposes.
               Congress, by abolishing slavery in the District, would do no such thing. It
               would merely change the <em>condition</em> of that which has been
               recognised as a qualified property by congressional acts, though previously
               declared "persons" by the constitution. More than this is done continually by
               Congress and every other Legislature. Property the most absolute and
               unqualified,

               is annihilated by legislative acts. The embargo and non-intercourse
               act, prostrated at a stroke, a forest of shipping, and sunk millions
               of capital. To say nothing of the power of Congress to take
               hundreds of millions from the people by direct taxation, who doubts
               its power to abolish at once the whole tariff system, change the seat
               of Government, arrest the progress of national works, prohibit any
               branch of commerce with the Indian tribes or with foreign nations,
               change the locality of forts, arsenals, magazines, dock yards, &amp;c., to
               abolish the Post Office system, the privilege of patents and copyrights,
               &amp;c. By such acts Congress might, in the exercise of its acknowledged
               powers, annihilate property to an incalculable amount, and
               that without becoming liable to claims for compensation.

            </p>
            <p>
               Finally, this clause prohibits the taking for public use of
               "<em>property</em>." The constitution of the United States does not
               recognise slaves as "PROPERTY" any where, and it does not recognise them in
               <em>any sense</em> in the District of Columbia. All allusions to them in
               the constitution recognise them as "persons." Every reference to them
               points <em>solely</em> to the element of <em>personality</em>; and
               thus, by the strongest implication, declares that the constitution
               <em>knows</em> them only as "persons," and <em>will</em> not
               recognise them in any other light. If they escape into
               free States, the constitution authorizes their being taken back. But
               how? Not as the property of an "owner," but as "persons;" and
               the peculiarity of the expression is a marked recognition of their
               <em>personality</em>&#8212;a refusal to recognise them as
               chattels&#8212;"persons <em>held</em> to service." Are <em>oxen</em>
               "<em>held</em> to service?" That can be affirmed only of
               <em>persons</em>. Again, slaves give political power as "persons." The
               constitution, in settling the principle of representation, requires their
               enumeration in the census. How? As property? Then why not
               include race horses and game cocks? Slaves, like other inhabitants,
               are enumerated as "persons." So by the constitution, the government
               was pledged to non-interference with "the migration or importation
               of such persons" as the States might think proper to admit until 1808,
               and authorized the laying of a tax on each "person" so admitted.
               Further, slaves are recognised as <em>persons</em> by the exaction of
               their <em>allegiance</em> to the government. For offences against the
               government slaves are tried as <em>persons</em>; as persons they are
               entitled to counsel for their defence, to the rules of evidence, and to
               "due process of law," and as <em>persons</em> they are punished. True,
               they are loaded with cruel disabilities in courts of law, such as greatly
               obstruct and often inevitably defeat the ends of justice, yet they are still
               recognised as <em>persons</em>. Even in the legislation of Congress, and
               in the diplomacy of the general government, notwithstanding the frequent and
               wide departures from the integrity of the constitution on this subject, slaves
               are not recognised as <em>property</em> without qualification. Congress
               has always refused to grant compensation for slaves killed or taken by the
               enemy, even when these slaves had been impressed into the United
               States' service. In half a score of cases since the last war, Congress
               has rejected such applications for compensation. Besides, both in

               Congressional acts, and in our national diplomacy, slaves and property
               are not used as convertible terms. When mentioned in treaties and
               state papers it is in such a way as to distinguish them from mere property,
               and generally by a recognition of their <em>personality</em>. In the
               invariable recognition of slaves as <em>persons</em>, the United States'
               constitution caught the mantle of the glorious Declaration, and most worthily
               wears it.&#8212;It recognizes all human beings as "men," "persons," and
               thus as "equals." In the original draft of the Declaration, as it
               came from the hand of Jefferson, it is alleged that Great Britain had
               "waged a cruel war against <em>human</em> nature itself, violating its
               most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people,
               carrying them into slavery,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* determined to keep up a market where
               MEN should be bought and sold,"&#8212;thus disdaining to make the charter
               of freedom a warrant for the arrest of <em>men</em>, that they might be
               shorn both of liberty and humanity.

            </p>
            <p>
               The celebrated Roger Sherman, one of the committee of five appointed
               to draft the Declaration of Independence, and also a member of the
               convention that formed the United States' constitution, said, in the first
               Congress after its adoption: "The constitution <em>does not consider these
                  persons,</em> (slaves,) <em>as a species of
                  property.</em>"&#8212;[Lloyd's Cong. Reg. v. 1, p. 313.] That the United
               States' Constitution does not make slaves "property," is shown in the fact
               that no person, either as a citizen of the United States, or by having his
               domicile within the United States' government, can hold slaves. He can hold
               them only by deriving his power from <em>state</em> laws, or from the
               laws of Congress, if he hold slaves within the District. But no person
               resident within the United States' jurisdiction, and not within the District,
               nor within a state whose laws support slavery, nor "held to service" under the
               laws of such state or district, having escaped therefrom, <em>can be held
                  as a slave</em>.

            </p>
            <p>
               Men can hold <em>property</em> under the United States' government though
               residing beyond the bounds of any state, district, or territory. An inhabitant
               of the Wisconsin Territory can hold property there under the
               laws of the United States, but he cannot hold <em>slaves</em> there under
               the United States' laws, nor by virtue of the United States' Constitution,
               nor upon the ground of his United States citizenship, nor by having
               his domicile within the United States' jurisdiction. The constitution
               no where recognizes the right to "slave property," <em>but merely the fact
                  that the states have jurisdiction each in its own limits, and that there
                  are certain "persons" within their jurisdictions "held to service" by
                  their own laws.</em></p>
            <p>
               Finally, in the clause under consideration, "private property"
               is not to be taken "without <em>just</em> compensation." "JUST!" If
               justice is to be appealed to in determining the amount of compensation,
               let her determine the <em>grounds</em> also. If it be her province to say
               <em>how much</em> compensation is "just," it is hers to say whether
               <em>any</em> is "just,"&#8212;whether the slave is "just" property
               <em>at all</em>, rather than a "<em>person</em>." Then, if justice
               adjudges the slave to be "private property,"

               it adjudges him to be <em>his own</em> property, since the right to one's
               <em>self</em> is the first right&#8212;the source of all others&#8212;the
               original stock by which they are accumulated&#8212;the principal, of which
               they are the interest. And since the slave's "private property" has been
               "taken," and since "compensation" is impossible&#8212;there being no
               <em>equivalent</em> for one's self&#8212;the least that can be done is to
               restore to him his original private property.

            </p>
            <p>
               Having shown that in abolishing slavery, "property" would not
               be "taken for public use," it may be added that, in those states where
               slavery has been abolished by law, no claim for compensation has
               been allowed. Indeed the manifest absurdity of demanding it, seems
               to have quite forstalled the <em>setting up</em> of such a claim.

            </p>
            <p>
               The abolition of slavery in the District, instead of being a legislative
               anomaly, would proceed upon the principles of every day legislation.
               It has been shown already, that the United States' Constitution
               does not recognize slaves as "property." Yet ordinary legislation is
               full of precedents, showing that even <i>absolute</i>
               property is in many respects wholly subject to legislation. The repeal of the
               law of entailments&#8212;all those acts that control the alienation of
               property, its disposal by will, its passing to heirs by descent, with the
               question, who shall be heirs, and what shall be the rule of distribution among
               them, or whether property shall be transmitted at all by descent, rather than
               escheat to the state&#8212;these, with statutes of limitation, and various
               other classes of legislative acts, serve to illustrate the acknowledged
               scope of the law-making power, even where property <em>is in every sense
                  absolute</em>. Persons whose property is thus affected by public laws,
               receive from the government no compensation for their losses, unless
               the state has been put in possession of the property taken from
               them.

            </p>
            <p>
               The preamble of the United States' Constitution declares it to be
               a fundamental object of the organization of the government "to ESTABLISH
               JUSTICE." Has Congress <em>no power</em> to do that for which
               it was made the <em>depository of power</em>? CANNOT the United States'
               Government fulfil the purpose <em>for which it was brought into
                  being</em>?

            </p>
            <p>
               To abolish slavery, is to take from no rightful owner his property;
               but to "<em>establish justice</em>" between two parties. To emancipate the
               slave, is to "<em>establish justice</em>" between him and
               his master&#8212;to throw around the person, character, conscience, liberty,
               and domestic relations of the one, <em>the same law</em> that secures and
               blesses the other. In other words, to prevent by <em>legal restraints</em>
               one class of men from seizing upon another class, and robbing them at pleasure
               of their earnings, their time, their liberty, their kindred, and the very use
               and ownership of their own persons. Finally, to abolish slavery is to proclaim
               and <em>enact</em> that innocence and helplessness&#8212;now <em>free
                  plunder</em>&#8212;are entitled to <em>legal protection</em>; and that
               power, avarice, and lust, shall no longer gorge upon their spoils under the
               license, and by the ministrations of <em>law</em>! Congress, by possessing
               "exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever," has a <em>general
                  protective power</em> for ALL the inhabitants

               of the District. If it has no power to protect <em>one</em> man, it has
               none to protect another&#8212;none to protect <em>any</em>&#8212;and if
               it <em>can</em> protect <em>one</em> man and is <em>bound</em>
               to protect him, it <em>can</em> protect <em>every</em> man&#8212;all
               men&#8212;and is <em>bound</em> to do it. All admit the power of Congress
               to protect the masters in the District against their slaves. What part of the
               constitution gives the power? The clause so often quoted,&#8212;"power of
               legislation in all cases whatsoever," equally in the "<em>case</em>" of
               defending the blacks against the whites, as in that of defending the whites
               against the blacks. The power is given also by Art. 1, Sec. 8,
               clause 15&#8212;"Congress shall have power to suppress insurrections"&#8212;a
               power to protect, as well blacks against whites, as whites against blacks. If
               the constitution gives power to protect <em>one</em> class against the
               other, it gives power to protect <em>either</em> against the other.
               Suppose the blacks in the District should seize the whites, drive them into
               the fields and kitchens, force them to work without pay, flog them, imprison
               them, and sell them at their pleasure, where would Congress find power to
               restrain such acts? Answer; a <em>general</em> power in the clause so
               often cited, and an <em>express</em> one in that cited
               above&#8212;"Congress shall have power to suppress insurrections." So much
               for a <em>supposed</em> case. Here follows a <em>real</em> one. The
               whites in the District <em>are perpetrating these identical acts</em> upon
               seven thousand blacks daily. That Congress has power to restrain these acts
               in <em>one</em> case, all assert, and in so doing they assert the power
               "in <em>all</em> cases whatsoever." For the grant of power to suppress
               insurrections, is an <em>unconditional</em> grant, not hampered by
               provisos as to the color, shape, size, sex, language, creed, or condition of
               the insurgents. Congress derives its power to suppress this
               <em>actual</em> insurrection, from the same source whence it derived its
               power to suppress the <em>same</em> acts in the case
               <em>supposed</em>. If one case is an insurrection, the other is. The
               <em>acts</em> in both are the same; the <em>actors</em> only are
               different. In the one case, ignorant and degraded&#8212;goaded by the memory
               of the past, stung by the
               present, and driven to desperation by the fearful looking for of wrongs
               for ever to come. In the other, enlightened into the nature of
               <em>rights</em>, the principles of justice, and the dictates of the law
               of love, unprovoked by wrongs, with cool deliberation, and by system, they
               perpetrate these acts upon those to whom they owe unnumbered obligations for
               <em>whole lives</em> of unrequited service. On which side may palliation
               be pleaded, and which party may most reasonably claim an abatement of
               the rigors of law? If Congress has power to suppress such acts
               <em>at all</em>, it has power to suppress them <em>in</em> all.

            </p>
            <p>
               It has been shown already that <i>allegiance</i> is
               exacted of the slave. Is the government of the United States unable to grant
               <em>protection</em> where it exacts <em>allegiance</em>? It is an
               axiom of the civilized world, and a maxim even with savages, that allegiance
               and protection are reciprocal and correlative. Are principles powerless with
               us which exact homage of barbarians? <em>Protection is the</em>
               CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT <em>of every human being under the exclusive
                  legislation of Congress who has not forfeited it by crime.</em></p>
            <p>
               In conclusion, I argue the power of Congress to abolish slavery
               in the District, from Art. 1, sec, 8, clause 1, of the constitution;
               "Congress shall have power to provide for the common defence and
               the general welfare of the United States." Has the government of
               the United States no power under this grant, to legislate within its
               own exclusive jurisdiction on subjects that vitally affect its interests?
               Suppose the slaves in the district should rise upon their masters, and
               the United States' government, in quelling the insurrection, should
               kill any number of them. Could their masters claim compensation of
               the government? Manifestly not; even though no proof existed that
               the particular slaves killed were insurgents. This was precisely the
               point at issue between those masters, whose slaves were killed by the
               State troops at the time of the Southampton insurrection, and the Virginia
               Legislature: no evidence was brought to show that the slaves
               killed by the troops were insurgents; yet the Virginia Legislature
               decided that their masters were <em>not entitled to compensation</em>.
               They proceeded on the sound principle, that a government may in
               self-protection destroy the claim of its subjects even to that which has
               been recognized as property by its own acts. If in providing for the
               common defence, the United States' government, in the case supposed,
               would have power to destroy slaves both as <em>property</em> and
               <em>persons</em>, it surely might stop <em>half-way</em>, destroy
               them <em>as property</em> while it legalized their existence as
               <em>persons</em>, and thus provided for the common defence
               by giving them a personal and powerful interest in the government,
               and securing their strength for its defence.

            </p>
            <p>
               Like other Legislatures, Congress has power to abate nuisances&#8212;to
               remove or tear down unsafe buildings&#8212;to destroy infected
               cargoes&#8212;to lay injunctions upon manufactories injurious to the public
               health&#8212;and thus to "provide for the common defence and general welfare"
               by destroying individual property, when such property puts in jeopardy
               the public weal.

            </p>
            <p>
               Granting, for argument's sake, that slaves are "property" in the
               District of Columbia&#8212;if Congress has a right to annihilate property
               in the District when the public safety requires it, it may surely annihilate
               its existence <em>as</em> property when the public safety requires it,
               especially if it transform into a <em>protection</em> and
               <em>defence</em> that which as <em>property</em> perilled the public
               interests. In the District of Columbia there are, besides the United States'
               Capitol, the President's house, the national offices, &amp;c. of the
               Departments of State, Treasury, War, and Navy, the General Post-office, and
               Patent Office. It is also the residence of the President, all the highest
               officers of the government, both houses of Congress, and all the foreign
               ambassadors. In this same District there are also <em>seven thousand
                  slaves</em>. Jefferson, in his Notes on Va. p. 241, says of slavery, that
               "the State permitting one half of its citizens to trample on the rights of
               the other, <em>transforms them into enemies</em>;" and Richard Henry Lee,
               in the Va. house of Burgesses in 1758, declared that to those who held them,
               "<em>slaves must be natural enemies</em>." Is Congress so
               <em>impotent</em> that it <em>cannot</em>
               exercise that right pronounced both by municipal and national law,
               the most sacred and universal&#8212;the right of self-preservation and
               defence? Is it shut up to the <em>necessity</em> of keeping seven thousand
               "enemies" in the heart of the nation's citadel? Does the iron fiat of
               the constitution doom it to such imbecility that it <em>cannot</em> arrest
               the process that <em>made</em> them "enemies," and still goads to deadlier
               hate by fiery trials, and day by day adds others to their number? Is
               <em>this</em> providing for the common defence and general welfare? If to
               rob men of rights excites their hate, freely to restore them and make
               amends, will win their love.

            </p>
            <p>
               By emancipating the slaves in the District, the government of the
               United States would disband an army of "enemies," and enlist "for
               the common defence and general welfare," a body guard of <em>friends</em>
               seven thousand strong. In the last year, a handful of British soldiers
               sacked Washington city, burned the capitol, the President's house,
               and the national offices and archives; and no marvel, for thousands
               of the inhabitants of the District had been "TRANSFORMED INTO ENEMIES."
               Would <em>they</em> beat back invasion? If the national government
               had exercised its constitutional "power to provide for the common
               defence and to promote the general welfare," by turning those "enemies"
               into friends, then, instead of a hostile ambush lurking in every
               thicket inviting assault, and secret foes in every house paralyzing
               defence, an army of allies would have rallied in the hour of her calamity,
               and shouted defiance from their munitions of rocks; whilst the
               banner of the republic, then trampled in dust, would have floated securely
               over FREEMEN exulting amidst bulwarks of strength.

            </p>
            <p>
               To show that Congress can abolish slavery in the District, under
               the grant of power "to provide for the common defence and to promote
               the general welfare," I quote an extract from a speech of Mr.
               Madison, of Va., in the first Congress under the constitution, May 13,
               1789. Speaking of the abolition of the slave trade, Mr. Madison
               says: "I should venture to say it is as much for the interests of
               Georgia and South Carolina, as of any state in the union. Every
               addition they receive to their number of slaves tends to <em>weaken</em>
               them, and renders them less capable of self-defence. In case of hostilities
               with foreign nations, they will be the means of <em>inviting</em> attack
               instead of repelling invasion. It is a necessary duty of the general
               government to protect every part of the empire against danger, as well
               <em>internal</em> as external. <em>Every thing, therefore, which tends
                  to increase this danger, though it may be a local affair, yet if it involves
                  national expense or safety, it becomes of concern to every part of the union,
                  and is a proper subject for the consideration of those charged with
                  the general administration of the government.</em>" See Cong. Reg. vol. 1,
               p. 310, 11.

               POSTSCRIPT

            </h3>
            <p>
               My apology for adding a <i>postscript</i>, to a
               discussion already perhaps too protracted, is the fact that the preceding
               sheets were in the hands of the printer, and all but the concluding pages had
               gone through the press, before the passage of Mr. Calhoun's late resolutions
               in the Senate of the United States. A proceeding so extraordinary,&#8212;if
               indeed the time has not passed when <em>any</em> acts of Congress in
               derogation of freedom and in deference to slavery, can be deemed
               extraordinary,&#8212;should not be suffered to pass in silence at such
               a crisis as the present; especially as the passage of one of the resolutions
               by a vote of 36 to 9, exhibits a shift of position on the part of the South,
               as sudden as it is unaccountable, being nothing less than the surrender of
               a fortress which until then they had defended with the pertinacity of a
               blind and almost infuriated fatuity. Upon the discussions during the pendency
               of the resolutions, and upon the vote, by which they were carried, I
               make no comment, save only to record my exultation in the fact there
               exhibited, that great emergencies are <em>true touchstones</em>, and that
               henceforward, until this question is settled, whoever holds a seat in Congress
               will find upon, and all around him, a pressure strong enough to TEST
               him&#8212;a focal blaze that will find its way through the carefully adjusted
               cloak of fair pretension, and the sevenfold brass of two-faced political
               intrigue, and <em>no</em>-faced <em>non-committalism</em>, piercing
               to the dividing asunder of joints and marrow. Be it known to every northern
               man who aspires to a seat in Congress, that hereafter it is the destiny of
               congressional action on this subject, to be a MIGHTY REVELATOR&#8212;making
               secret thoughts public property, and proclaiming on the house-tops what is
               whispered in the ear&#8212;smiting off masks, and bursting open sepulchres
               beautiful outwardly, and heaving up to the sun their dead men's bones. To
               such we say,&#8212;<em>Remember the Missouri Question, and the fate of those
                  who then sold the North, and their own birthright</em>!

               Passing by the resolutions generally without remark&#8212;the attention of

               fifth resolution.

                  "Resolved, That when the District of Columbia was ceded by the states
                  of Virginia and Maryland to the United States, domestic slavery existed in
                  both of these states, including the ceded territory, and that, as it still
                  continues in both of them, it could not be abolished within the District
                  without a violation of that good faith, which was implied in the cession and
                  in the acceptance of the territory; nor, unless compensation were made to the
                  proprietors of slaves, without a manifest infringement of an amendment to the
                  constitution of the United States; nor without exciting a degree of just
                  alarm and apprehension in the states recognizing slavery, far transcending
                  in mischievous tendency, any possible benefit which could be accomplished
                  by the abolition."

               By voting for this resolution, the south, by a simultaneous movement,
               shifted its mode of defense, not so much by taking a position entirely new,
               as by attempting to refortify an old one&#8212;never much trusted in, and
               abandoned mainly long ago, as being unable to hold out against assault however

               unskilfully directed. In the debate on this resolution, though the southern
               members of Congress did not <em>professedly</em> retreat from the ground
               hitherto maintained by them&#8212;that Congress has no power by the
               constitution to abolish slavery in the District&#8212;yet in the main they
               silently drew off from it.

            </p>
            <p>
               The passage of this resolution&#8212;with the vote of every southern senator,
               forms a new era in the discussion of this question.

            </p>
            <p>
               We cannot join in the lamentations of those who bewail it. We hail it,
               and rejoice in it. It was as we would have had it&#8212;offered by a southern
               senator, advocated by southern senators, and on the ground that it "was no
               compromise"&#8212;that it embodied the true southern principle&#8212;that
               "this resolution stood on as high ground as Mr. Calhoun's"&#8212;(Mr.
               Preston)&#8212;"that Mr. Clay's resolution was as strong as Mr.
               Calhoun's"&#8212;(Mr.  Rives)&#8212;that "the resolution he (Mr. Calhoun) now
               refused to support, was as strong as his own, and that in supporting it, there
               was no abandonment of principle by the south."&#8212;(Mr. Walker,
               of Mi.)&#8212;further, that it was advocated by the southern senators
               generally as an expression of their views, and as setting the question of
               slavery in the District on its <em>true</em> ground&#8212;that
               finally when the question was taken, every slaveholding senator, including
               Mr. Calhoun himself, voted for the resolution.

            </p>
            <p>
               By passing this resolution, and with such avowals, the south has surrendered
               irrevocably the whole question at issue between them and the
               petitioners for abolition in the District. It has, unwittingly but explicitly,
               conceded the main question argued in the preceding pages.

            </p>
            <p>
               The <em>only</em> ground taken against the right of Congress to abolish
               slavery in the District is, that it existed in Maryland and Virginia when the
               cession was made, and "<em>as it still continues in both of them</em>, it
               could not be abolished without a violation of that good faith which was
               implied in the cession." &amp;c. The <em>sole argument</em> is
               <em>not</em> that exclusive <em>sovereignty</em> has no
               power to abolish slavery within its jurisdiction, <em>nor</em> that the
               powers of even <em>ordinary legislation</em> cannot do
               it,&#8212;<em>nor</em> that the clause granting Congress "exclusive
               legislation in all cases whatsoever over such District," gives no power to do
               it; but that the <em>unexpressed expectation</em> of one of the parties
               that the other would not "in <em>all</em> cases" <em>use</em> the
               power which said party had consented <em>might be used</em> "<em>in all
                  cases</em>," <em>prohibits</em> the use of it. The only cardinal point
               in the discussion, is here not only <em>yielded</em>, but formally laid
               down by the South as the leading article in their creed on the question of
               Congressional jurisdiction over slavery in the District. The <em>sole
                  reason</em> given why Congress should not abolish, and the sole evidence
               that if it did, such abolition would be a violation of "good faith," is that
               "<em>slavery still continues in those states</em>,"&#8212;thus explicitly
               admitting, that if slavery did <em>not</em> "still continue" in those
               States, Congress <em>could</em> abolish it in the District. The same
               admission is made also in the <em>premises</em>, which state that slavery
               existed in those states <em>at the time of the cession</em>, &amp;c.
               Admitting that if it had <em>not</em> existed there then, but had grown
               up in the District under <em>United States' laws</em>, Congress might
               constitutionally abolish it. Or that if the ceded parts of those states had
               been the <em>only</em> parts in which slaves were held under
               their laws, Congress might have abolished in such a contingency also. The
               cession in that case leaving no slaves in those states,&#8212;no "good faith,"
               would be "implied" in it, nor any "violated," by an act of abolition. The
               principle of the resolution makes this further admission, that if Maryland
               and Virginia should at once abolish their slavery, Congress might at once
               abolish it in the District. The principle goes even further than this, and
               <em>requires</em> Congress in such case to abolish slavery in the
               District "by the <em>good faith implied</em> in the cession and acceptance
               of the territory." Since,

               according to the spirit and scope of the resolution, this "implied good faith"
               of Maryland and Virginia in making the cession, was that Congress would
               do nothing within the District which should go to counteract the policy, or
               bring into disrepute the "institutions," or call in question the usages, or
               even in any way ruffle the prejudices of those states, or do what
               <em>they</em> might think would unfavorably bear upon their interests;
               <em>themselves</em> of course being the judges.

            </p>
            <p>
               But let us dissect another limb of the resolution. What is to be understood
               by "that good faith which was IMPLIED?" It is of course an admission that
               such a condition was not <em>expressed</em> in the acts of
               cession&#8212;that in their <em>terms</em> there is nothing restricting
               the power of Congress on the subject of slavery in the District&#8212;not a
               word alluding to it, nor one inserted with such an <em>intent</em>.
               This "implied faith," then, rests on no clause or word in the United States'
               Constitution, or in the acts of cession, or in the acts of Congress accepting
               the cession, nor does it rest on any declarations of the legislatures of
               Maryland and Virginia made at the time, or in that generation, nor on any
               <em>act</em> of theirs, nor on any declaration of the people of those
               states, nor on the testimony of the Washingtons, Jeffersons, Madisons, Chaces,
               Martins, and Jennifers, of those states and times. The assertion rests
               <em>on itself alone</em>! Mr. Clay and the other senators who voted for
               the resolution, <em>guess</em> that Maryland and Virginia supposed that
               Congress would by no means <em>use</em> the power given them by the
               constitution, except in such ways as would be well pleasing in the eyes of
               those states; especially as one of them was the "Ancient Dominion!" And now
               after the lapse of half a century, this <em>assumed expectation</em>
               of Maryland and Virginia, the existence of which is mere matter of conjecture
               with the 36 senators, is conjured up and duly installed upon the
               judgment-seat of final appeal, before whose nod constitutions are to flee
               away, and with whom, solemn grants of power and explicit guaranties are,
               when weighed in the balance, altogether lighter than vanity!

            </p>
            <p>
               But let us survey it in another light. Why did Maryland and Virginia
               leave so much to be "<em>implied</em>?" Why did they not in some way
               express what lay so near their hearts? Had their vocabulary run so low
               that a single word could not be eked out for the occasion? Or were
               those states so bashful of a sudden that they dare not speak out and
               tell what they wanted? Or did they take it for granted that Congress
               would always act in the premises according to their wishes, and that too,
               without their <em>making known</em> their wishes? If, as honorable
               senators tell us, Maryland and Virginia did verily travail with such
               abounding <em>faith</em>, why brought they forth no <em>works</em>?

            </p>
            <p>
               It is as true in <em>legislation</em> as in religion, that the only
               <em>evidence</em> of "faith" is <em>works</em>, and that "faith"
               <em>without</em> works is <em>dead</em>, i.e. has no
               <em>power</em>. But here, forsooth, a blind implication with nothing
               <em>expressed</em>, an "implied" <em>faith</em> without works, is
               <em>omnipotent</em>. Mr. Clay is lawyer enough to know that even a
               <em>senatorial hypothesis</em> as to what must have been the
               <em>understanding</em> of Maryland and Virginia about congressional
               exercise of constitutional power, <em>abrogates no grant</em>, and that
               to plead it in a court of law, would be of small service except to jostle
               "their Honors'" gravity! He need not be told that the constitution gives
               Congress "power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over
               such District." Nor that the legislatures of Maryland and Virginia constructed
               their acts of cession with this clause <em>before their eyes</em>, and
               that both of them declared those acts made "in <em>pursuance</em>" of said
               clause. Those states were aware that the United States in their constitution
               had left nothing to be "<em>implied</em>" as to the power
               of Congress over the District;&#8212;an admonition quite sufficient one would

               think to put them on their guard, and induce them to eschew vague implications
               and resort to <i>stipulations</i>. Full well did they
               know also that those were times when, in matters of high import,
               <em>nothing</em> was left to be "implied." The colonies were then panting
               from a twenty years' conflict with the mother country, about bills of rights,
               charters, treaties, constitutions, grants, limitations, and
               <em>acts of cession</em>. The severities of a long and terrible discipline
               had taught them to guard at all points <i>legislative
                  grants</i>, that their exact import and limit might be
               self-evident&#8212;leaving no scope for a blind "faith," that
               <em>somehow</em> in the lottery of chances there would be no blanks,
               but making all sure by the use of explicit terms, and wisely chosen words,
               and <em>just enough</em> of them. The Constitution of the United States
               with its amendments, those of the individual states, the national treaties,
               the public documents of the general and state governments at that period, show
               the universal conviction of legislative bodies, that when great public
               interest were at stake, nothing should be left to be "implied."

            </p>
            <p>
               Further: suppose Maryland and Virginia had expressed their "implied
               faith" in <em>words</em>, and embodied it in their acts of cession as a
               proviso, declaring that Congress should not "exercise exclusive legislation
               in <em>all</em> cases whatsoever over the District," but that the "case"
               of <em>slavery</em> should be an exception: who does not know that
               Congress, if it had accepted the cession on those terms, would have violated
               the Constitution; and who that has ever studied the free mood of those times
               in its bearings on slavery&#8212;proofs of which are given in scores on the
               preceding pages&#8212;can for an instant believe that the people of the United
               States would have altered their Constitution for the purpose of providing for
               slavery an inviolable sanctuary; that when driven in from its outposts, and
               everywhere retreating discomfited before the march of freedom, it might be
               received into everlasting habitations on the common homestead and hearth-stone
               of this free republic? Besides, who can believe that Virginia made such a
               condition, or cherished such a purpose, when at that very moment, Washington,
               Jefferson, Wythe, Patrick Henry, St. George Tucker, and almost all her
               illustrious men, were advocating the abolition of slavery by law. When
               Washington had said, two years before, Maryland and Virginia "must have laws
               for the gradual abolition of slavery and at a period <em>not remote</em>;"
               and when Jefferson in his letter to Price, three years before the cession,
               had said, speaking of Virginia, "This is the next state to which we may turn
               our eyes for the interesting spectacle of justice in conflict with avarice
               and oppression&#8212;a conflict in which THE SACRED SIDE IS GAINING DAILY
               RECRUITS;" when voluntary emancipations on the soil were then progressing at
               the rate of between one and two thousand annually, (See Judge Tucker's
               "Dissertation on Slavery," p. 73;) when the public sentiment of Virginia had
               undergone, and was undergoing so mighty a revolution that the idea of the
               continuance of slavery as a permanent system could not be
               <em>tolerated</em>, though she then contained about half the slaves
               in the Union. Was this the time to stipulated for the <em>perpetuity</em>
               of slavery under the exclusive legislation of Congress? and that too at the
               <em>same</em> session of Congress when <em>every one</em> of her
               delegation voted for the abolition of slavery in the North West Territory; a
               territory which she had herself ceded to Congress, and along with it had
               surrendered her jurisdiction over many of her
               citizens, inhabitants of that territory, who held slaves there&#8212;and whose
               slaves were emancipated by that act of Congress, in which all her delegation
               with one accord participated?

            </p>
            <p>
               Now in view of the universal belief then prevalent, that slavery in this
               country was doomed to short life, and especially that in Maryland and Virginia
               it would be <em>speedily</em> abolished&#8212;are we to be told that
               those states <em>designed</em>
               to bind Congress <em>never</em> to terminate it? Are we to adopt the
               monstrous conclusion that this was the intent of the Ancient
               Dominion&#8212;thus to <em>bind</em> the United States by an "implied
               faith," and that when the United States <em>accepted</em> the cession,
               she did solemnly thus plight her troth, and that Virginia did then so
               <em>understand</em> it? Verily one would think that honorable
               senators supposed themselves deputed to do our <em>thinking</em> as well
               as our legislation, or rather, that they themselves were absolved from such
               drudgery by virtue of their office!

            </p>
            <p>
               Another absurdity of this dogma about "implied faith" is, that where
               there was no power to exact an <em>express</em> pledge, there was none to
               demand an <em>implied</em> one, and where there was no power to
               <em>give</em> the one, there was none to give the <em>other</em>. We
               have shown already that Congress could not have accepted the cession with
               such a condition. To have signed away a part of its constitutional grant of
               power would have been a <em>breach</em> of the Constitution. Further, the
               Congress which accepted the cession was competent to pass a resolution
               pledging itself not to <em>use all</em> the power over the District
               committed to it by the Constitution. But here its power ended. Its resolution
               would only bind <em>itself</em>. Could it bind the <em>next</em>
               Congress by its authority? Could the members of one Congress say to the
               members of another, because we do not choose to exercise all the authority
               vested in us by the Constitution, therefore you <em>shall</em> not? This
               would have been a prohibition to do what the Constitution gives power to do.
               Each successive Congress would still have gone to the Constitution for its
               power, brushing away in its course the cobwebs stretched across its path by
               the officiousness of an impertinent predecessor. Again, the legislatures of
               Virginia and Maryland, had no power to bind Congress, either by an express or
               an implied pledge, never to abolish slavery in the District. Those
               legislatures had no power to bind <em>themselves</em> never to abolish
               slavery within their own territories&#8212;the ceded parts included. Where
               then would they get power to bind <em>another</em> not to do what they
               had no power to bind themselves not to do? If a legislature could not in this
               respect control the successive legislatures of its own State, could it
               control the successive Congresses of the United States?

            </p>
            <p>
               But perhaps we shall be told, that the "implied faith" in the acts of cession
               of Maryland and Virginia was <em>not</em> that Congress should
               <em>never</em> abolish slavery in the District, but that it should not do
               it until <em>they</em> had done it within their bounds! Verily this
               "faith" comes little short of the faith of miracles! "A good rule that works
               both ways." First, Maryland and Virginia have "good faith" that Congress will
               <em>not</em> abolish until <em>they</em> do; and then just as "good
               faith" that Congress <em>will</em> abolish <em>when</em> they do!
               Excellently accommodated! Did those States suppose that Congress would
               legislate over the national domain, the common jurisdiction of
               <em>all</em>, for Maryland and Virginia alone? And who, did they suppose,
               would be judges in the matter?&#8212;themselves merely? or the whole Union?

            </p>
            <p>
               This "good faith implied in the cession" is no longer of doubtful
               interpretation. The principle at the bottom of it, when fairly stated, is
               this:&#8212;That the Government of the United States are bound in "good faith"
               to do in the District of Columbia, without demurring, just what and when,
               Maryland and Virginia do in their own States. In short, that the general
               government is eased of all the burdens of legislation within its exclusive
               jurisdiction, save that of hiring a scrivener to copy off the acts of the
               Maryland and Virginia legislatures as fast as they are passed, and engross
               them, under the title of "Laws of the United States, for the District of
               Columbia!" A slight additional expense would also be incurred in keeping up an
               express between the capitols

               of those States and Washington city, bringing Congress from time to time
               its "<em>instructions</em>" from head quarters&#8212;instructions not to
               be disregarded without a violation of that "good faith implied in the
               cession," &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               This sets in strong light the advantages of "our glorious Union," if the
               doctrine of Mr. Clay and the thirty-six Senators be orthodox. The people
               of the United States have been permitted to set up at their own expense,
               and on their own territory, two great <i>sounding
                  boards</i> called "Senate Chamber" and "Representatives' Hall," for the
               purpose of sending abroad "by authority" <i>national</i>
               echoes of <em>state</em> legislation!&#8212;permitted also to keep in
               their pay a corps of pliant <i>national</i> musicians,
               with peremptory instructions to sound on any line of the staff according as
               Virginia and Maryland may give the <i>sovereign</i> key
               note!

            </p>
            <p>
               Though this may have the seeming of mere raillery, yet an analysis of
               the resolution and of the discussions upon it, will convince every fair mind
               that it is but the legitimate carrying out of the <em>principle</em>
               pervading both. They proceed virtually upon the hypothesis that the will and
               pleasure of Virginia and Maryland are <em>paramount</em> to those of the
               <em>Union</em>. If the main design of setting apart a federal district
               had been originally the accommodation of Maryland, Virginia, and the south,
               with the United States as an <i>agent</i> to consummate
               the object, there could hardly have been higher assumption or louder vaunting.
               The sole object of <em>having</em> such a District was in effect totally
               perverted in the resolution of Mr. Clay, and in the discussions of the entire
               southern delegation, upon its passage. Instead of taking the ground, that the
               benefit of the whole Union was the sole <em>object</em> of a federal
               district, that it was designed to guard and promote the interests of
               <em>all</em> the states, and that it was to be legislated over
               <em>for this end</em>&#8212;the resolution proceeds upon an hypothesis
               <em>totally the reverse</em>. It takes a single point of
               <em>state</em> policy, and exalts it above NATIONAL interests, utterly
               overshadowing them; abrogating national <em>rights</em>; making void a
               clause of the Constitution; humbling the general government into a
               subject&#8212;crouching for favors to a superior, and that too
               <em>on its own exclusive jurisdiction</em>. All the attributes of
               sovereignty vested in Congress by the Constitution it impales upon the
               point of an alleged <em>implication</em>. And this is Mr. Clay's
               peace-offering, to appease the lust of power and the ravenings of state
               encroachment! A "compromise," forsooth! that sinks the general Government on
               <em>its own territory</em> into a mere colony, with Virginia and Maryland
               for its "mother country!" It is refreshing to turn from these shallow,
               distorted constructions and servile cringings, to the high bearing of other
               southern men in other times; men, who in their character of legislators and
               lawyers, disdained to accommodate their interpretations of constitutions and
               charters to geographical lines, or to bend them to the purposes of a political
               canvass. In the celebrated case of Cohens vs. the State of Virginia, Hon.
               William Pinkney, late of Baltimore, and Hon. Walter Jones, of Washington city,
               with other eminent constitutional lawyers, prepared an elaborate written
               opinion, from which the following is an extract: "Nor is there any danger
               to be apprehended from allowing to Congressional legislation with regard to
               the District of Columbia, its FULLEST EFFECT. Congress is responsible to
               the States, and to the people for that legislation. It is in truth the
               legislation of the states over a district placed under their control for
               <em>their own benefit</em>, not for that of the District, except as the
               prosperity of the District is involved, and necessary to the <em>general
                  advantage</em>."&#8212;[Life of Pinkney, p.  612.]

            </p>
            <p>
               The profound legal opinion, from which this is an extract, was elaborated
               at great length many years since, by a number of the most distinguished

               lawyers in the United States, whose signatures are appended to it. It is
               specific and to the point. It asserts, 1st, that Congressional legislation
               over the District, is "the legislation of the <em>States</em> and the
               <em>people</em>," (not of <em>two</em> states, and a mere
               <em>fraction</em> of the people;) 2d. "Over a District placed under
               <em>their</em> control," i.e. under the control of the <em>whole</em>
               of the States, not under the control of <em>two twenty-sixths</em> of
               them. 3d. That it was thus put under their Control "<em>for THEIR OWN
                  benefit</em>," the benefit of all the States <em>equally</em>; not to
               secure special benefits to Maryland and Virginia, (or what it might be
               <em>conjectured</em> they would regard as benefits.) 4th. It concludes by
               asserting that the design of this exclusive control of Congress over the
               District was "not for the benefit of the <em>District</em>," except as
               that is <em>connected</em> with, and <em>a means of promoting</em> the
               <em>general</em> advantage. If this is the case with the
               <em>District</em>, which is <em>directly</em> concerned, it is
               pre-eminently so with Maryland and Virginia, who are but
               <em>indirectly</em> interested, and would be but remotely affected by it.
               The argument of Mr. Madison in the Congress of '89, an extract from which has
               been given on a preceding page, lays down the same principle; that though any
               matter "<i>may be a local affair, yet if it involves national
                  EXPENSE OR SAFETY, it becomes of concern to every part of the union, and is
                  a proper subject for the consideration of those charged with the general
                  administration of the government</i>." Cong. Reg. vol. 1. p. 310, 11.

            </p>
            <p>
               But these are only the initiatory absurdities of this "good
               faith <em>implied</em>." The thirty-six senators aptly illustrate the
               principle, that error not only conflicts with truth, but is generally at
               issue with itself. For if it would be a violation of "good faith" to Maryland
               and Virginia, for Congress to abolish slavery in the District, it would be
               <em>equally</em> a violation for Congress to do it <em>with the
                  consent</em>, or even at the earnest and unanimous petition of the
               people of the District: yet for years it has been the southern doctrine, that
               if the people of the District demand of Congress relief in this respect, it
               has power, as their local legislature, to grant it, and by abolishing slavery
               there, carry out the will of the citizens. But now new light has broken in!
               The optics of the thirty-six have pierced the millstone with a deeper insight,
               and discoveries thicken faster than they can be telegraphed! Congress has no
               power, O no, not a modicum, to help the slaveholders of the District, however
               loudly they may clamor for it. The southern doctrine, that Congress is
               to the District a mere local Legislature to do its pleasure, is tumbled from
               the genitive into the vocative! Hard fate&#8212;and that too at the hands of
               those who begat it! The reasonings of Messrs. Pinckney, Wise, and Leigh, are
               now found to be wholly at fault, and the chanticleer rhetoric of Messrs.
               Glascock and Garland stalks featherless and crest-fallen. For, Mr. Clay's
               resolution sweeps by the board all those stereotyped common-places, as
               "Congress a local Legislature," "consent of the District," "bound to consult
               the wishes of the District," &amp;c. &amp;c., which for the last two sessions
               of Congress have served to eke out scanty supplies. It declares, that
               <i>as slavery existed in Maryland and Virginia at the time
                  of the cession, and as it still continues in both those states, it could not
                  be abolished in the District without a violation of 'that good
                  faith</i>,' &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               But let us see where this principle of the <em>thirty-six</em> will lead
               us. If "implied faith" to Maryland and Virginia <em>restrains</em>
               Congress from the abolition of slavery in the District, it
               <em>requires</em> Congress to do in the District
               what those states have done within their bounds, i.e., restrain
               <em>others</em> from abolishing it. Upon the same principle Congress is
               <em>bound</em>, by the doctrine of Mr. Clay's resolution, to
               <em>prohibit emancipation</em> within the District.
               There is no <em>stopping place</em> for this plighted "faith." Congress
               must

               not only refrain from laying violent hands on slavery, <em>itself</em>,
               and see to it that the slaveholders themselves do not, but it is bound to keep
               the system up to the Maryland and Virginia standard of vigor!

            </p>
            <p>
               Again, if the good faith of Congress to Virginia and Maryland requires
               that slavery should exist in the District, while it exists in those states, it
               requires that it should exist there <em>as</em> it exists in those states.
               If to abolish <em>every</em> form of slavery in the District would violate
               good faith, to abolish <em>the</em> form existing in those states, and to
               substitute a totally different one, would also violate it. The Congressional
               "good faith" is to be kept not only with <em>slavery</em>, but with the
               <em>Maryland and Virginia systems</em> of slavery. The faith of
               those states not being in the preservation of <em>a</em> system, but of
               <em>their</em> system; otherwise Congress, instead of
               <em>sustaining</em>, would counteract their policy&#8212;principles
               would be brought into action there conflicting with their system,
               and thus the true spirit of the "implied" pledge would be violated. On
               this principle, so long as slaves are "chattels personal" in Virginia and
               Maryland, Congress could not make them <i>real estate</i>,
               inseparable from the soil, as in Louisiana; nor could it permit slaves to
               read, nor to worship God according to conscience; nor could it grant them
               trial by jury, nor legalize marriage; nor require the master to give
               sufficient food and clothing; nor prohibit the violent sundering of
               families&#8212;because such provisions would conflict with the existing slave
               laws of Virginia and Maryland, and thus violate the "good faith implied,"
               &amp;c. So the principle of the resolution binds Congress in all these
               particulars: 1st. Not to abolish slavery in the District <em>until</em>
               Virginia and Maryland abolish. 2d. Not to abolish any <em>part</em> of it
               that exists in those states. 3d. Not to abolish any <em>form</em> or
               <em>appendage</em> of it still existing in those states. 4th. <em>To
                  abolish</em> when they do. 5th. To increase or abate its rigors <em>when,
                  how</em>, and <em>as</em> the same are modified by those states. In a
               word, Congressional action in the District is to float passively in the wake
               of legislative action on the subject in those states.

            </p>
            <p>
               But here comes a dilemma. Suppose the legislation of those states
               should steer different courses&#8212;then there would be <em>two</em>
               wakes! Can Congress float in both? Yea, verily! Nothing is too hard for it!
               Its obsequiousness equals its "power of legislation in <em>all</em> cases
               whatsoever." It can float <em>up</em> on the Virginia tide, and ebb down
               on the Maryland at the same time. What Maryland does, Congress will do in the
               Maryland part. What Virginia does, Congress will do in the Virginia part.
               Though Congress might not always be able to run at the bidding of both
               <em>at once</em>, especially in different directions, yet if it obeyed
               orders cheerfully, and "kept in its place," according to its "good faith
               implied," impossibilities might not be rigidly exacted. True, we have the
               highest sanction for the maxim that no <em>man</em> can serve two
               masters&#8212;but if "corporations have <em>no</em> souls," analogy would
               absolve Congress on that score, or at most give it only <em>a very small
                  soul</em>&#8212;not large enough to be at all in the way, as an
               <em>exception</em> to the universal rule laid down in the maxim!

            </p>
            <p>
               In following out the absurdities of this "<em>implied</em> good faith,"
               it will be seen at once that the doctrine of Mr. Clay's Resolution extends to
               <em>all the subjects</em> of <em>legislation</em> existing in Maryland
               and Virginia, which exist also within the District. Every system,
               "institution," law, and established usage there, is placed beyond
               Congressional control equally with slavery, and by the same "implied faith."
               The abolition of the lottery system in the District as an
               <em>immorality</em>, was a flagrant breach of this "good faith" to
               Maryland and Virginia, as the system "still continued in those states." So
               to abolish imprisonment for debt, and capital punishment, to remodel
               the bank system, the power of corporations, the militia law, laws of

               limitation, &amp;c., in the District, <em>unless Virginia and Maryland took
                  the lead</em>, would violate the "good faith implied in the cession,"
               &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>
               That in the acts of cession no such "good faith" was "implied by Virginia
               and Maryland" as is claimed in the Resolution, we argue from the
               fact, that in 1784 Virginia ceded to the United States all her northwest
               territory, with the special proviso that her citizens inhabiting that
               territory should "have their <em>possessions</em> and <em>titles</em>
               confirmed to them, and be <em>protected</em> in the enjoyment of their
               <em>rights</em> and liberties." (See Journals of Congress, vol. 9, p. 63.)
               The cession was made in the form of a deed, and signed by Thomas Jefferson,
               Samuel Hardy, Arthur Lee, and James Monroe. Many of these inhabitants
               <em>held slaves</em>. Three years after the cession, the Virginia
               delegation in Congress <em>proposed</em> the passage of an ordinance
               which should abolish slavery, in that territory, and declare that it should
               never thereafter exist there. All the members of Congress from Virginia and
               Maryland voted for this ordinance. Suppose some member of Congress
               had during the passage of the ordinance introduced the following
               resolution: "Resolved, That when the northwest territory was ceded
               by Virginia to the United States, domestic slavery existed in that State,
               including the ceded territory, and as it still continues in that State,
               it could not be abolished within the territory without a violation of that
               good faith, which was implied in the cession and in the acceptance of the
               territory." What would have been the indignant response of Grayson, Griffin,
               Madison, and the Lees, in the Congress of '87, to such a resolution, and of
               Carrington, Chairman of the Committee, who reported the ratification of the
               ordinance in the Congress of '89, and of Page and Parker, who with every
               other member of the Virginia delegation supported it!

            </p>
            <p>
               But to enumerate all the absurdities into which the thirty-six Senators
               have plunged themselves, would be to make a quarto inventory. We decline
               the task; and in conclusion, merely add that Mr. Clay, in presenting
               this resolution, and each of the thirty-six Senators who voted for it, entered
               on the records of the Senate, and proclaimed to the world, a most unworthy
               accusation against the MILLIONS of American citizens who have during nearly
               half a century petitioned the national legislature to abolish slavery in the
               District of Columbia,&#8212;charging them either with the ignorance or the
               impiety of praying the nation to violate its "PLIGHTED FAITH." The resolution
               virtually indicts at the bar of public opinion, and brands with odium, all the
               Manumission Societies, the <em>first</em> petitioners for the abolition of
               slavery in the District, and for a long time the only ones, petitioning from
               year to year through evil report and good report, still petitioning, by
               individual societies and in their national conventions.

               But as if it were not enough to table the charge against such men as Benjamin
               Rush, William Rawle, John Sergeant, Robert Vaux, Cadwallader Colden, and
               Peter A. Jay,&#8212;to whom we may add Rufus King, James Hillhouse,
               William Pinkney, Thomas Addis Emmett, Daniel D. Tompkins, De
               Witt Clinton, James Kent, and Daniel Webster, besides eleven hundred
               citizens of the District itself, headed by their Chief Justice and
               judges&#8212;even
               the sovereign States of Pennsylvania, New-York, Massachusetts, and Vermont,
               whose legislatures have either memorialized Congress to abolish slavery
               in the District, or instructed their Senators to move such a measure, must be
               gravely informed by Messrs. Clay, Norvell, Niles, Smith, Pierce, Benton,
               Black, Tipton, and other honorable Senators, either that their perception is
               so dull, they know not what of they affirm, or that their moral sense is so
               blunted they can demand without compunction a violation of the nation's faith!

            </p>
            <p>
               We have spoken already of the concessions unwittingly made in this

               resolution to the true doctrine of Congressional power over the District.
               For that concession, important as it is, we have small thanks to render.
               That such a resolution, passed with such an <em>intent</em>, and pressing
               at a thousand points on relations and interests vital to the free states,
               should be hailed, as it has been, by a portion of the northern press as a
               "compromise" originating in deference to northern interests, and to be
               received by us as a free-will offering of disinterested benevolence, demanding
               our gratitude to the mover,&#8212;may well cover us with shame. We deserve the
               humiliation and have well earned the mockery. Let it come!

            </p>
            <p>
               If, after having been set up at auction in the public sales-room of the
               nation, and for thirty years, and by each of a score of "compromises,"
               treacherously knocked off to the lowest bidder, and that without money and
               without price, the North, plundered and betrayed, <em>will not</em>, in
               this her accepted time, consider the things that belong to her peace before
               they are hidden from her eyes, then let her eat of the fruit of her own way,
               and be filled with her own devices! Let the shorn and blinded giant grind in
               the prison-house of the Philistines, till taught the folly of intrusting to
               Delilahs the secret and the custody of his strength.

            </p>
            <p>
               Have the free States bound themselves by an oath never to profit by the
               lessons of experience? If lost to <em>reason</em>, are they dead to
               <em>instinct</em> also? Can nothing rouse them to cast about for self
               preservation? And shall a life of tame surrenders be terminated by suicidal
               sacrifice?

            </p>
            <p>
               A "COMPROMISE!" Bitter irony! Is the plucked and hood-winked
               North to be wheedled by the sorcery of another Missouri compromise? A
               compromise in which the South gained all, and the North lost all, and lost it
               for ever. A compromise which embargoed the free laborer of the North and
               West, and clutched at the staff he leaned upon, to turn it into a bludgeon and
               fell him with its stroke. A compromise which wrested from liberty her
               boundless birthright domain, stretching westward to the sunset, while it gave
               to slavery loose reins and a free course, from the Mississippi to the Pacific.

            </p>
            <p>
               The resolution, as it finally passed, is here inserted. The original
               Resolution, as moved by Mr. Clay, was inserted at the head of this postscript
               with the impression that it was the <em>amended</em> form. It will be seen
               however, that it underwent no material modification.

            </p>
            <p>
               "Resolved, That the interference by the citizens of any of the states,
               with the view to the abolition of slavery in the District, is endangering the
               rights and security of the people of the District; and that any act or measure
               of Congress designed to abolish slavery in the District, would be a violation
               of the faith implied in the cessions by the states of Virginia and Maryland,
               a just cause of alarm to the people of the slaveholding states, and
               have a direct and inevitable tendency to disturb and endanger the Union."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
